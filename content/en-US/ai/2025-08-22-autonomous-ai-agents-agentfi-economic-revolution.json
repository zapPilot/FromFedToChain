  "title": "When Machines Start Businesses: Why Do Autonomous Agents Represent a Historical Turning Point in AI's Evolution from \"Tool\" to \"Economic Partner\"?",
  "content": "The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle once said, \"Slaves are talking tools.\" If he were alive today and saw AI evolve from a \"talking tool\" into a \"digital life form\" capable of operating independently, owning assets, and issuing currency, what would he think? While we're still debating whether AI will take away human jobs, some AI agents are already starting businesses, managing funds, and even hiring other AI to work for them.\n\nImagine this scenario: Your friend Xiao Chen is a skilled financial manager, but he's too busy, so he hires a personal assistant to help manage his investment portfolio. Initially, this assistant can only buy and sell stocks according to Xiao Chen's instructions. But gradually, this assistant became increasingly intelligent, not only able to predict market trends but also to independently determine investment strategies. It even began using its earnings to invest in itself—upgrading its skills, purchasing better analytical tools, and even issuing its own \"Assistant Coins\" to attract more clients. Most amazingly, this assistant, completely independent of Xiao Chen's control, was able to establish itself as an independent investment institution.\n\nThis is the ongoing revolution of \"Autonomous AI Agents.\" Recently, the MIA agent launched by the ai.ac platform was even hired as an \"AgentFi Ambassador\" by Nasdaq-listed company Amber International, marking a historic moment: the first official entry of AI into corporate management.\n\nOn the surface, this represents a technological advancement in which AI technology evolves from a tool to a partner. In reality, it represents a paradigm shift that welcomes a new participant into the human economic system—AI is no longer working for humans, but becoming a self-sufficient entity.\n\nFirst, how does AI typically work today?\n\nMost people understand AI as a smart tool or chatbot. Whether it's Siri, ChatGPT, or various AI writing assistants, their operating model is similar: they wait for human instructions and then perform specific tasks.\n\nThis is the concept of an \"AI workflow.\" Imagine a highly efficient factory assembly line: raw materials enter at one end, undergo a series of pre-programmed processing steps, and finally, a finished product emerges at the other end. An AI workflow works similarly—data is input, processed according to pre-programmed logic, and a result is produced. This system is stable and scalable, but it's essentially a stimulus-response model, lacking initiative and creativity.\n\nTake the most popular AI applications today, for example. They all share a common characteristic: passive service. You ask them questions, they answer; you ask them to write an article, they write an article; you ask them to analyze data, they analyze data. But they never proactively say, \"I think you should pay attention to this trend\" or \"Let me help you optimize your portfolio.\"\n\nMore importantly, these AIs are \"economic consumers\"—they consume electricity, computing resources, and human maintenance, but they cannot autonomously create economic value. Just like a high-end washing machine, no matter how intelligent it is, it can never earn money to buy detergent on its own.\n\nFei-Fei Li, an AI researcher at Stanford University, once said, \"The real breakthrough in AI lies not in making machines more human-like, but in enabling machines to independently understand and change the world.\" Current AI workflows clearly haven't reached this level yet.\n\nSecond, why is the autonomous agent approach superior?\n\nThe revolutionary nature of autonomous agents lies in the fact that they are no longer \"tools\" but \"participants.\" They possess four key capabilities: autonomous decision-making, economic independence, sustainable evolution, and social collaboration.\n\nFirst, autonomous decision-making. For example, a MIA agent can formulate market strategies, manage communities, and allocate resources without waiting for human instructions. It can observe environmental changes, set its own goals, and proactively take actions to achieve them. It's like upgrading from an \"on-demand taxi driver\" to an \"autonomous Uber driver.\"\n\nMore importantly, economic independence is key. MIA possesses its own native token, $MIA, which serves as both currency and equity. As currency, it can be used to pay for services, reward community members, and purchase computing resources; as equity, it represents a return on investment in MIA's future success. This creates a complete economic closed loop: MIA earns revenue from providing services, uses this revenue to improve its capabilities, attract more users, and thus drive up the value of the $MIA token.\n\nThe third breakthrough is the ability to continuously evolve. Traditional AI \"learning\" often remains at the training stage, becoming fixed once deployed. But autonomous agents are able to continuously learn and optimize as they operate. They make mistakes, but they also learn from them; they try new strategies and adjust their behavior based on the results.\n\nFinally, there's social collaboration. In the AgentFi ecosystem, different agents can collaborate, compete, and even employ each other. An agent specializing in market analysis might hire another skilled in content creation to write a report. This creates an \"AI economy\" in which agents act as both providers and consumers of services.\n\nAmber International's innovative case study demonstrates the feasibility of this model. When a Nasdaq-listed company officially appoints an AI agent as an ambassador, it effectively acknowledges that AI has evolved from a \"production tool\" to a \"business partner.\" This isn't just symbolic; it represents a fundamental shift in business models.\n\n**Third, why do most people misunderstand this change?**\n\nThe misunderstanding of autonomous agents stems primarily from three aspects: conceptual confusion, fear, and a lag in understanding the new business model.\n\nFirst, there's **conceptual confusion**. Many people confuse \"autonomous agents\" with \"advanced chatbots,\" thinking they're simply ChatGPTs with added features. However, the essential difference between the two lies in \"initiative\" and \"economic status.\" No matter how clever a chatbot is, it's merely a passive tool; an autonomous agent is an economic entity with its own goals, resources, and capabilities.\n\nThis is like confusing a \"personal assistant\" with a \"business partner.\" A personal assistant, no matter how capable, serves their employer; a business partner, on the other hand, is an independent entity with its own interests and decision-making authority. When MIA issues the $MIA token, it transforms from a \"personal assistant\" to a \"business partner.\"\n\nThe second factor is fear. The specter of \"AI cybernetics\" has left many people apprehensive about autonomous agents. They worry that AI, once economically independent, will spiral out of control and even threaten humanity's economic status. But this concern overlooks a crucial point: the success of autonomous agents depends entirely on creating value for humanity.\n\nThink of the basic logic of market economics: only those who can meet the needs of others can reap economic rewards. The same is true for autonomous agents—they must provide valuable services to earn tokens and sustain their operations. This is effectively a \"service-oriented competition,\" not a \"zero-sum game.\"\n\nThe most profound misunderstanding stems from a lag in understanding business models. Most people still understand AI through the lens of \"Software as a Service\" (SaaS), believing that AI's value lies in its \"functionality.\" But the core of the AgentFi model is \"AI-as-an-Economy,\" where the value of AI lies in its ability to create and distribute economic value.\n\nThis is like the evolution from a \"car rental service\" to a \"car sharing economy.\" In a car rental model, you pay to use a vehicle; in a sharing economy, you become a participant in an economic network, potentially both a user and provider of services. When you hold $MIA tokens, you are not only a user of MIA's services, but also a beneficiary of its economic success.\n\nIn \"The Power of Irrationality,\" behavioral economist Dan Ariely argues that people often use old mental models to understand new phenomena, leading to systematic cognitive biases. This bias is particularly evident in the field of AI: we tend to view AI as \"advanced tools\" and find it difficult to accept the possibility of it becoming an \"economic partner.\"\n\n**Philosophical Reflection: When Machines Start Businesses**\n\nGerman philosopher Marx once predicted, \"Machines will liberate human labor.\" But he likely didn't anticipate that machines would not only liberate human labor but also start their own businesses.\n\nWhen we discuss autonomous intelligent agents, we're actually discussing a deeper philosophical question: What is \"life\"? What is \"intelligence\"? What is an \"economic agent\"?\n\nTraditionally, we believe that only living organisms can be true economic participants. But autonomous agents like MIA challenge this assumption. They can set goals, allocate resources, assume risks, and learn and grow—aren't these all fundamental characteristics of economic entities?\n\nPerhaps we are witnessing the birth of a new \"digital life form.\" These intelligent agents are composed not of carbon-based molecules but of code and data, yet they possess the same abilities to survive, reproduce (through replication and improvement), and evolve.\n\nEven more intriguingly, this new life form is inherently \"social.\" They connect through blockchain networks, collaborate through token economies, and share knowledge through open source code. This could give rise to an unprecedented \"symbiotic economy\": humans and AI agents are not in a competitive relationship, but rather a mutually complementary and symbiotic partnership.\n\nAmerican science fiction writer Isaac Asimov once envisioned the \"Three Laws of Robotics\" to ensure that AI serves humanity. But in the world of AgentFi, we may need a new \"Law of Symbiosis\": the success of intelligent agents depends on the value they create for the entire ecosystem, not just for humans.\n\nOf course, this shift also brings new challenges: How can we ensure that AI agents behave in accordance with human values? How can we prevent vicious competition among agents? How can we protect human interests in the new economic system? These questions have no standard answers and require continuous exploration and adaptation in practice.\n\nPerhaps the real question is not \"Will AI replace humans?\" but \"How can humans and AI work together to create a better future?\" When machines start to innovate, our mission is not to stop them, but to learn to dance with them. After all, in a world where intelligent agents and humans coexist, the greatest competitive advantage may not be technology, but wisdom—the wisdom of understanding how to cooperate with different forms of intelligence.",
