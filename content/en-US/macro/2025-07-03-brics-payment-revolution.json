  "title": "The blockchain payment revolution of the PBC nation: redefining global financial sovereignty",
  "content": "Have you ever thought about what impact it would have on the global financial landscape when China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa join forces to build a payment system that bypasses SWIFT? In October 2024, China officially fully supports the BRICS PAY system. This is not a simple payment tool, but a fundamental challenge to the Western-dominated financial infrastructure. Today we will deeply analyze this quiet revolution that is rewriting the rules of global finance.   From concept to reality: BRICS PAY's technological breakthrough Many people think that BRICS PAY is just a political slogan, but in fact, the technical architecture of this system is already quite mature. The core technology is the \"Decentralized Cross-Border Messaging System\" (DCMS) developed by St. Petersburg State University. The most unique thing about this system is that it is decentralized and does not completely rely on the infrastructure of any single country. DCMS uses blockchain technology, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, it is a consortium chain, and only the central banks and authorized financial institutions of BRICS member countries can participate in verification. More importantly, the system plans to be open source after the pilot phase, which means that other countries that want to get rid of SWIFT dependence can also use this technology. This design cleverly balances control and openness: BRICS countries maintain control over the system, while attracting more countries to join through open source to form a network effect.   Technical Challenges of US Dollar Hegemony Let us first understand why the SWIFT system is so important. SWIFT is not just a messaging system, it is the nerve center for the global flow of US dollars. When the United States imposes financial sanctions on a country, it actually cuts off the country's connection with SWIFT, making it unable to conduct international trade settled in US dollars. After the Russian-Ukrainian war, Western countries kicked major Russian banks out of the SWIFT system, which made the world realize a problem: over-reliance on a single financial infrastructure is extremely dangerous. BRICS PAY's response is: We don't need the US dollar or SWIFT. BRICS countries can directly settle trade in their own currencies and ensure the transparency and security of transactions through blockchain technology. Currently, about 20-30% of bilateral trade between BRICS countries is settled in local currencies. If BRICS PAY is successfully promoted, this proportion may exceed 50% in 2025. This will be a major challenge to the international reserve currency status of the US dollar.   China's strategic considerations For China, BRICS PAY is not only a payment system, but also an important part of the RMB internationalization strategy. First, BRICS PAY provides a new international circulation channel for RMB. When Brazilian soybean exporters can directly accept RMB payments without converting them into US dollars first, the international use scenarios of RMB will be greatly increased. Second, China's digital RMB (DCEP) technology can be seamlessly connected to the BRICS PAY system. Imagine that an African mining company can directly receive payments from Chinese buyers in digital RMB, and the entire process completely bypasses the US dollar system. More importantly, BRICS PAY forms a strategic synergy with the Belt and Road Initiative. Countries along the route can settle trade with China through the BRICS PAY system, reducing their dependence on the US dollar while enjoying lower transaction costs and faster settlement speeds.   Technical advantages and practical challenges From a purely technical perspective, BRICS PAY does have significant advantages over SWIFT:  Speed : Blockchain-native BRICS PAY can achieve near-instant settlement, while the SWIFT system usually takes 1-3 working days.  Cost : Multiple intermediaries have been removed, and transaction costs have been greatly reduced.  Transparency : The tamper-proof nature of the blockchain provides higher transaction transparency.  Anti-censorship : There is no single control point, making it more difficult to be cut off by external forces. But the challenges are equally huge:  Network effect : SWIFT is powerful because 99% of the world's banks use it. BRICS PAY needs time to build sufficient network coverage.  Liquidity issues : The deep liquidity of the US dollar is unmatched by other currencies. Even if BRICS countries trade in their own currencies, they will eventually need some kind of reserve currency to balance trade differences.  Regulatory complexity : The financial regulatory systems of the five countries vary greatly, and how to coordinate regulatory policies is a difficult problem.   The new dynamics of geopolitics The launch of BRICS PAY is reshaping the global geopolitical landscape. We see some interesting phenomena:  The dilemma of choice for middle countries : Countries like Turkey and Argentina want to maintain financial ties with the West, but also want alternatives. BRICS PAY gives them a hedging option.  US countermeasures : The United States will not sit idly by and watch SWIFT's monopoly challenged. We may see more threats of financial sanctions, or the United States launches its own digital dollar to deal with it.  Europe's dilemma : On the one hand, the EU is an ally of the United States, but on the other hand, it does not want to be completely subject to the US dollar system. Europe may promote the establishment of a third independent payment system.   The special role of India and Russia India and Russia play a special role in the development of BRICS PAY. Russia is the main promoter of this project because it most urgently needs an alternative to SWIFT. The digital ruble being developed by the Russian Central Bank is planned to be officially circulated in 2025, which will form a supporting system for the BRICS PAY system. India provides a huge market and technical capabilities. India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is already one of the most successful digital payment systems in the world, processing more than 10 billion transactions a day. This technical experience is crucial to the success of BRICS PAY. More interestingly, India and Russia are already using the ruble-ruble trade settlement mechanism, providing valuable experience for the practical application of BRICS PAY.   Impact on global financial stability The success of BRICS PAY will have a far-reaching impact on global financial stability.  Positive impact :\n- Reduce systemic risk and reduce dependence on a single payment system\n- Promote competition and improve the efficiency of financial services\n- Provide more options for emerging market countries  Potential risks :\n- The fragmentation of the global financial system may increase transaction costs\n- Regulatory arbitrage may lead to money laundering and terrorist financing risks\n- Exchange rate fluctuations may increase, affecting the stability of international trade The International Monetary Fund has begun to pay attention to this trend and is considering how to adjust its regulatory framework to cope with the multipolar payment system.   Investment and Business Opportunities For Chinese companies and investors, the development of BRICS PAY has created new opportunities:  Cross-border e-commerce : Chinese e-commerce platforms can directly accept local currency payments from other BRICS countries through BRICS PAY, reducing exchange rate risks.  Supply chain finance : Supply chain finance products based on BRICS PAY can provide more efficient financing solutions for the \"Belt and Road\" projects.  Fintech going overseas : Chinese fintech companies can use their understanding of the BRICS PAY technical architecture to export solutions to other emerging markets.  RMB asset allocation : As BRICS PAY promotes the use of RMB, overseas demand for RMB assets may increase, bringing new capital inflows to China's financial markets.   Timeline and Milestones While the exact launch date of BRICS PAY is still uncertain, we can track several key milestones:  First half of 2025 : Russian digital ruble is expected to be officially circulated, providing the technical foundation for BRICS PAY.  Second half of 2025 : Cross-border pilots may be conducted, first tested in China-Russia or India-Russia trade.  2026 : If the pilot is successful, the system may be opened to other BRICS+ countries.  2027-2030 : Become one of the main payment options for emerging market countries.   Conclusion: The beginning of a new financial order BRICS PAY is not just a technical project, it represents a fundamental change in the global financial order. We are witnessing a shift from a unipolar to a multipolar financial system. For China, this is a historic opportunity. Through BRICS PAY, China can promote the internationalization of the RMB, reduce its dependence on the US dollar system, and strengthen its economic ties with other emerging markets. But it is also a huge challenge. Building a global financial infrastructure that can compete with SWIFT requires not only technological innovation, but also political wisdom, economic strength and strategic patience. Regardless of the final outcome, the launch of BRICS PAY marks the beginning of a new era: in this era, financial sovereignty is no longer the monopoly of Western countries, and emerging markets have their own voice. The final direction of this payment revolution will have a profound impact on the global economic landscape in the next few decades. China's choices and performance in this process will determine whether the RMB can truly become a global currency.",
