  "title": "When Businesses Become Coin-Buying Machines: Is the Crypto Treasury Company's mNAV Flywheel a Financial Innovation or a Ponzi Scam?",
  "content": "German philosopher Hegel once said, \"The only lesson history teaches us is that we never learn from it.\" In 2025, a new financial phenomenon is reiterating this ancient wisdom. When we see digital asset management companies (DATs) raising over $15 billion in just one year, using the proceeds from stock offerings to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, you might wonder: Isn't this just turning traditional businesses into \"coin-buying machines\"?\n\nImagine this scenario: Your friend Xiao Wang opens a restaurant that originally sells beef noodles. But one day, he realized that instead of working hard to run the restaurant, he could use all the profits to buy gold. He could then tell investors, \"We're now a gold reserve company!\" Even more amazingly, the market bought in. Far from questioning his strategy, investors frantically bought his stock, driving the price far above the actual value of the gold held by the restaurant. Xiao Wang then used this premium to raise more funds, buy more gold, causing the stock price to rise again, and then continue raising funds to buy gold... This cycle seemed to continue indefinitely. This is the same game that DAT companies are currently playing, except that the gold is being exchanged for cryptocurrency.\n\nOn the surface, the DAT strategy represents a breakthrough in corporate capital allocation; the real problem is that we are witnessing a reflexive bubble based on market mispricing, which relies at its core on investors' willingness to pay a persistent premium for the \"buy-the-money story.\"\n\nFirst, how is corporate treasury management typically performed?\n\nIn the traditional world of corporate finance, treasury management follows a clear and conservative logic. Like a prudent housewife managing the household budget, a CFO allocates funds according to categories: short-term working capital is placed in bank deposits to ensure daily expenses; medium-term funds are invested in high-grade bonds, balancing safety and profitability; and only long-term idle funds are invested in stocks or other risky assets.\n\nThe core philosophy of this approach derives from modern portfolio theory and the Modigliani-Miller theorem. Developed in 1958 by MIT's Franco Modigliani, the Modigliani-Miller theorem states that under ideal market conditions, a company's value is independent of its capital structure. In other words, a company's value should derive from its operational capabilities, not its financial skills. The traditional CFO's job is to \"put finance at the service of the business,\" reducing financial costs through sound capital management and allowing management to focus on creating real business value.\n\nFor example, even with $160 billion in cash, Apple primarily invests in government bonds and high-grade corporate debt, rather than pursuing high-risk, high-yield investments. The same is true of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Despite Buffett's reputation as an investment guru, the company's insurance business capital allocation prioritizes stability. While this conservatism may seem to miss out on high-yield opportunities, it provides the company with a stable financial foundation, allowing it to focus on building its core competitive advantage.\n\nHowever, this system also has a clear weakness: opportunity cost. When inflation exceeds 3% and a company's cash only earns a 1% return, buying power is effectively eroded. When Bitcoin's annualized return reaches 80%, shareholders holding cash begin to question whether management is being \"too conservative.\"\n\nSecond, why does the DAT strategy appear more attractive? **\n\nDAT companies have invented a mind-bogglingly clever piece of financial engineering: the \"mNAV flywheel\" mechanism. mNAV stands for \"Market-to-Net Asset Value,\" which simply means the multiple of the stock market value to the value of the company's actual assets. When this multiple is greater than 1, the magic begins.\n\nFor example, MicroStrategy holds $10 billion worth of Bitcoin, but its stock market value is $11 billion (mNAV = 1.1). This means that for every $1 in new shares issued, the company can buy $1.1 worth of Bitcoin, instantly creating value for existing shareholders. Even more astonishing is BitMine Immersion, whose ETH holdings have grown by 640% month-over-month. The premium of its stock price to NAV allows it to continue raising funds, creating a positive cycle of \"buying coins → rising stock prices → raising more funds → buying more coins.\"\n\nThis strategy solves several practical problems. First, the \"compliant channel\": Many institutional investors cannot directly purchase cryptocurrencies due to regulatory restrictions, but they can purchase shares in publicly listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies. Second, the illusion of \"professional management\": Investors believe that corporate management has professional advantages in trading timing, safekeeping, and tax processing. The most important factor is the \"leverage effect\": through debt financing, investors can gain amplified cryptocurrency exposure.\n\nThe adoption of the fair value accounting standard (FASB ASU 2023-08) in the United States in 2025 also adds a boost. Companies can now record cryptocurrencies at market value, with quarterly fluctuations directly reflected on the income statement, making DAT companies' performance appear more \"real.\" Twenty One Capital's $3.6 billion in backing from Tether and SoftBank demonstrates mainstream capital's acceptance of this model.\n\nMathematically, this creates a truly astonishing return amplification effect. When the underlying cryptocurrency rises 50%, the DAT company's stock could potentially rise 100% or more. This \"digital gold mining company\" concept allows investors to enjoy both the benefits of rising cryptocurrency prices and the added bonus of stock premiums.\n\n**Third, why do most people misunderstand this model?**\n\nThe misunderstanding of the DAT strategy stems primarily from three cognitive blind spots: the reflexivity trap, the illusion of innovation, and an underestimation of systemic risk.\n\nThe most dangerous is the \"reflexivity trap.\" George Soros's reflexivity theory teaches us that market participants' perceptions influence market reality, and market reality, in turn, influences participants' perceptions, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. The DAT's mNAV flywheel is a perfect example of reflexivity, but most investors only see the positive side, overlooking its double-edged sword nature. When Bitcoin or Ethereum prices fall, the DAT company's balance sheet deteriorates, and its stock price can plummet even further than its underlying assets, shifting its mNAV from a premium to a discount. Once mNAV falls below 1.0, the flywheel reverses: the company can no longer issue new shares at a premium and may even be forced to sell cryptocurrency to repurchase shares, further depressing the cryptocurrency price.\n\nThe second issue is the \"illusion of innovation.\" Many people regard the DAT strategy as financial innovation, but it more closely resembles a regulatory arbitrage product. With the increasing popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, institutional investors now have a more direct and affordable way to gain cryptocurrency exposure. Why take on corporate governance risks, pay management fees, and endure additional stock price volatility just to indirectly own cryptocurrencies? It's like navigating a bumpy road after building a highway.\n\nThe most overlooked risk is systemic risk. DAT companies currently hold 3.4% of the total Ethereum supply. If multiple companies were forced to sell simultaneously (for example, if mNAV fell below 1.0 or faced regulatory pressure), it could cause a stampede across the entire cryptocurrency market. We've seen countless similar examples throughout history: the conglomerate boom of the 1960s, the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, CDO derivatives in 2008... Each time, it's always \"this time is different,\" and each time the outcome is the same.\n\nBehavioral economics teaches us that people use simplistic mental shortcuts when faced with complex problems. The simple equation \"Buy MicroStrategy = Buy Bitcoin\" allows investors to avoid the complexities of learning blockchain technology and analyzing market structure, but it also causes them to overlook issues like company-specific risks, leverage risk, and liquidity risk. When market sentiment shifts, these overlooked risks can explode.\n\nReturning to Hegel's famous quote, perhaps it's truly difficult to learn from history. But at least we can remain vigilant: when an investment strategy seems simple, almost \"brainless,\" it often means the complexity has been shifted elsewhere. DATs transfer the complexity of cryptocurrency investing to corporate management, the risk of timing to market premiums, and the liquidity risk to stock trading. These risks haven't disappeared; they've simply been temporarily hidden.\n\nTrue wisdom lies not in judging the DAT strategy's merits but in understanding its place in the evolution of finance. Perhaps it truly is a necessary bridge to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency, or perhaps it's just another financial innovation that will be forgotten by history. But no matter what, when the tide goes out, we will know who is swimming naked. For investors, the best strategy is to understand the rules of the game, but not to become part of the game yourself.",
