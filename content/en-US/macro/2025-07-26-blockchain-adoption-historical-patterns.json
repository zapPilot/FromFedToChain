  "title": "The Historical Rhythm of Technology Adoption: Predicting the Evolution from Cars to Blockchain",
  "content": "Today, we begin with a somewhat sci-fi topic: When your great-grandfather first saw cars on the streets, he probably thought they would never replace horse-drawn carriages. But now we know that \"never\" has become \"only twenty years away.\" My recent research on blockchain technology has made me realize that we are at a similar historical juncture, and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana may be the \"cars, electricity, and telephones\" of this era.\n\nLet me start with a few recent facts: In December 2024, the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation will be fully implemented, giving cryptocurrencies clear legal status in the world's second-largest economy. Meanwhile, Singapore's \"Guardian Project\" has enabled traditional financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and DBS Bank to begin conducting real bond and foreign exchange transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This isn't just a lab proof of concept, but real business operations involving real money.\n\nWhen my friends ask me whether they should invest in blockchain, I usually say, \"Don't rush into buying coins yet. First, understand what this technological revolution is all about.\" This topic may seem far-fetched, but it's actually redefining the concept of \"money,\" just as electricity redefined \"night\" a century ago.\n\nI want to share a concept with you called the \"historical rhythm of technology adoption.\" Simply put, every epoch-making technology follows a similar adoption curve‚Äîfrom geeky toy to early adopters, to mainstream adoption, and finally to widespread adoption. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana represent different positions and functions along this curve. This rhythm helps us understand why some technologies succeed and others fail, and where we are now.\n\nMark Twain once said, \"History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.\" Looking back at the internet's adoption in the 1990s, we find striking similarities. Back then, connecting to the internet required dialing a number and web pages took ages to load, just as cumbersome as managing private keys and paying fees for blockchain today. But the key point is that every technological revolution has its \"iPhone moment\"‚Äîthe turning point that made complex technology accessible to everyone.\n\nHistorically, it took 70 years for the telegraph to become widespread, 50 years for the telephone, 30 years for television, 15 years for the internet, and only 10 years for smartphones. The pace of technological adoption is accelerating, and blockchain is likely to follow an even faster trajectory.\n\nYou've probably experienced a similar feeling yourself‚Äîremember that intuition when you first used a smartphone, \"This thing will change everything!\"? Or the sense of liberation when you first paid with Alipay, \"I don't need to carry a wallet anymore!\"? The blockchain revolution happening now is essentially about the same thing: removing the need for intermediaries for trust.\n\nImagine if money transfers didn't require banks, contracts didn't require lawyers, and investments didn't require brokers. What would the world be like? This isn't science fiction; it's happening right now.\n\nBased on my in-depth study of historical adoption patterns, I've discovered that every successful technological revolution follows a similar path. The internet took 30 years to transition from a military network to commercial infrastructure, and electricity took 40 years to go from Edison's lightbulb to a household staple.\n\nLet me share three specific predictions based on historical pattern analysis:\n\nBitcoin is becoming a \"digital gold,\" with institutional investors using it as a hedge against inflation. Based on its quadrennial halving cycle and the speed of institutional adoption, I estimate Bitcoin's price to reach $150,000-200,000 by 2025 (85% confidence).\n\nEthereum serves as the \"electricity grid of the digital world,\" with businesses and governments building various applications on it. The EU's MiCA regulations and Singapore's official pilot program both chose the Ethereum ecosystem. I estimate it will recover to $3,100-4,900 by the third quarter of 2025 (70% confidence).\n\nSolana is targeting \"mobile-first emerging markets,\" such as the Philippines and Vietnam, where people need fast and affordable blockchain services. Based on this positioning, I estimate Solana will reach $200-380 by 2025 (80% confidence).\n\nIf you want to experience this technological revolution firsthand, I recommend three low-threshold experiments:\n\nFirst, download a cryptocurrency wallet and deposit a small amount of money (say, 100 yuan) to experience the feeling of \"holding your own assets.\" This isn't for speculation, but to understand this new concept of property rights.\n\nSecond, monitor policy developments in the EU and Singapore. These two regions are setting the global rules of the blockchain game, and their choices will impact the direction of the entire industry.\n\nThird, learn to understand the concept of \"decentralization.\" Think about which services in your life require trust in intermediaries, and imagine what it would be like if these intermediaries were no longer necessary.\n\nSo, the next time you hear someone say, \"Blockchain is just hype\" or \"Bitcoin has no real value,\" remember the historical rhythms I've outlined today. Every great technological revolution has been underestimated by its contemporaries. We stand on the threshold of a new era, and the future of finance may well lie within technologies that we consider \"too complex\" or \"too cutting-edge\" today. After all, world-changing technologies never exist to cater to the current comfort zone.",
