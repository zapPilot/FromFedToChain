  "title": "Even stablecoin issuers want to be ‚Äúlandlords‚Äù: Why did USDC and USDT start building their own blockchain kingdom?",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why McDonald's isn't just about selling burgers; it's also about becoming a real estate tycoon? Why isn't Apple just about making phones, but also building its own App Store ecosystem? In the business world, true winners never simply provide products; they control the entire value chain. This principle now applies to the world of cryptocurrency‚Äîstablecoin issuers are no longer content with simply \"issuing\" coins; they want to build their own blockchain empires.\n\n## The Transformation from Tenant to Landlord\n\nImagine this scenario: You own a successful coffee shop in Taipei and pay your landlord NT$100,000 in rent each month. As business gets better, you realize your monthly rent payments are almost as much as your net profit. What do you think? Any smart businessperson would think, \"Why not buy the building and become a landlord myself?\"\n\nThis is exactly what Circle had in mind when it announced the Arc blockchain in August 2025. Circle is the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which currently has $61.3 billion in circulation, making it the second-largest stablecoin after USDT. However, the majority of this USDC is run on other blockchains‚ÄîEthereum, Solana, Polygon, and others. Whenever users transfer USDC, the transaction fees go to the miners or validators of these blockchains, not Circle. At the same time, a new blockchain called \"Stable\" is being developed, specifically designed for USDT (Tether) and backed by Bitfinex, a company closely associated with Tether. This blockchain has just completed a $28 million seed round and plans to launch its mainnet in the third or fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nOn the surface, this is about technological innovation and improved user experience; in reality, it's a business battle for value capture and ecosystem control.\n\n## First, how do stablecoins work now?\n\nThe current stablecoin model is like a \"staying at someone else's house\" business model. Circle issues USDC, but it must rely on other blockchains for infrastructure. This model presents several issues:\n\nValue Loss: Every time a user transfers USDC, the fees go to Ethereum miners, not Circle. Data shows that USDC transactions on Ethereum are enormous, meaning Circle is watching a significant amount of money flow into other people's pockets every day.\n\nLimited Experience: To use USDC on Ethereum, users must also hold ETH to pay for gas. This is like buying groceries with USD but having to pay for parking with JPY. For users who simply want to transfer money, this presents a significant user experience barrier.\n\nControlled by Others: When the Ethereum network is congested, USDC transfers become slow and expensive. Technical issues on other blockchains can also affect USDC. Circle has effectively handed over its core product to its competitors.\n\nEconomists call this phenomenon \"unequal profit distribution on the value chain.\" Just as Apple pockets the lion's share of iPhone profits, while assembly manufacturer Foxconn earns only a meager manufacturing fee, under the current model, blockchain infrastructure providers pocket the lion's share of transaction fees.\n\n## Second, what's the best approach?\n\nFrom a business logic perspective, vertical integration is indeed a smart strategy. Circle's Arc blockchain and the Stablechain designed for USDT both employ a revolutionary design: using the stablecoin itself as the gas token.\n\n**Technical Advantages**: Arc Chain uses USDC as its native gas token, meaning users only need to hold USDC to complete all transactions, without the need for additional tokens. Furthermore, the chain is optimized for stablecoin transfers, promising sub-second transaction confirmation times and processing capabilities of 3,000 to 10,000 transactions per second.\n\n**Closed-loop Business**: More importantly, this creates a perfect closed-loop business. Circle not only earns money from its USDC reserve investments (earning billions of dollars in interest annually), but now also collects fees from every transaction. It's like McDonald's not only making money from selling burgers, but also collecting rent from its storefront.\n\n**Regulatory-Friendly**: A blockchain controlled by a single entity is actually easier for regulators to oversee. Circle can directly integrate KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) functionality at the protocol level, even automating the enforcement of OFAC sanctions lists. This presents a safer and more compliant option for traditional financial institutions looking to enter the digital asset space.\n\nHowever, this approach also presents philosophical problems. When Ben Franklin said, \"He who controls the money controls the nation,\" he could never have imagined that private companies would one day control both the issuance and the infrastructure of currency.\n\n## Third, why do most people get it wrong?\n\nMany people's first reaction to this trend is, \"This is a step backward for decentralization\" or \"This will kill Ethereum.\" However, these perspectives overlook a crucial issue: the true nature of network effects.\n... Layer 2 solutions (such as Arbitrum and Optimism) have significantly reduced transaction costs, but account abstraction technology allows users to pay gas fees directly with USDC, eliminating Arc Chain's primary advantage in terms of user experience. This is like Uber's counterattack against the traditional taxi industry; the advantage may be temporary.\n\n**Misconception 3: Ignoring the significant risk of liquidity fragmentation**\nDeFi's power comes from its composability‚Äîdifferent protocols can be combined like Lego blocks to create innovation. If USDC liquidity is fragmented within a closed ecosystem, it will undermine the capital efficiency of the entire DeFi ecosystem. It's like dispersing all the water from a large lake into countless small ponds; each pond will be insufficiently deep.\n\nIn \"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School notes that successful companies often make poor decisions when faced with disruptive innovations because they become overly focused on the needs of existing customers. For stablecoin issuers, pursuing short-term value capture can sacrifice long-term network effects and innovative momentum.\n\n## Philosophical Reflection: Who Should Control the Future of Money?\n\nThroughout history, every evolution of the monetary system has been accompanied by a redistribution of power. From gold to paper money, from paper money to digital payments, and now to cryptocurrencies, each step has revisited the fundamental question of \"Who controls money?\"\n\nWhen stablecoin issuers build their own blockchains, they are essentially rebuilding a new financial infrastructure, only this time the central bank is a private company. This is both a logical necessity and a challenge to the ideal of decentralization.\n\nPerhaps we need to ask ourselves a deeper question: In this new digital world, do we want a few large tech companies to control everything, or do we want an open, diverse, and competitive ecosystem? The success or failure of Circle's Arc Chain and Stable Chain is not just a business case; it is a practical test of this fundamental philosophical question.\n\nAs physicist Niels Bohr said, \"Prediction is difficult, especially about the future.\" But one thing is certain: when money begins to redefine its boundaries, the very rules of the world will change. As witnesses and participants in this transformation, perhaps our best attitude is to remain curious and prepared for a future we don't yet fully understand.",
