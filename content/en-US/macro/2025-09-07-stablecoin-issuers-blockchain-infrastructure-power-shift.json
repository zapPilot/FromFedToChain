  "title": "When Stablecoins Start \"Buying Houses\": The Power Restructuring Behind Tether, Circle, and Ethena's Self-Built Blockchains",
  "content": "In his book \"The Denationalization of Money,\" economist Friedrich Hayek proposed a radical idea: allowing different private institutions to issue currencies and compete freely in the market, with the best currency emerging as the winner. This idea, considered utopian in 1976, is quietly becoming a reality in 2025. As stablecoin giants like Tether, Circle, and Ethena cease to be content with issuing tokens on others' blockchains and begin building their own blockchain networks, we are witnessing a critical turning point in financial history—a shift in power from \"borrowing infrastructure\" to \"owning it.\"\n\nImagine this scenario: Your friend, Xiao Wang, runs a successful coffee chain. Business is booming, selling thousands of cups of coffee daily. However, all of his locations are rented, and he has to pay exorbitant rents to various landlords every month. Worse still, these landlords not only charge rent but also restrict his hours, decor, and even dictate the types of coffee he can sell. Until one day, Xiao Wang decides to stop renting and instead buys land and builds his own. From then on, he has complete autonomy—he can operate 24/7, design his own locations, and even charge other coffee brands a \"residence fee.\" This is the transition that stablecoin issuers are currently undergoing: from \"renting\" on blockchains run by \"landlords\" like Ethereum and Solana to \"buying\" on their own blockchains.\n\nOn the surface, this is a business decision about optimizing technical architecture and controlling costs; in reality, it's a power play over who will control the future of digital financial infrastructure.\n\nFirst, how do stablecoins typically operate?\n\nUnder the traditional model, stablecoin issuers act like \"digital dollar printing plants,\" but they must operate within someone else's \"printing room.\" For example, USDT must be issued on Ethereum, and each transfer requires paying ETH as a processing fee to Ethereum miners or validators. While Tether earns generous interest from its reserve assets (Treasury bonds, money market funds, etc.)—projected to reach $13.7 billion in profits in 2024—it receives zero share of user transaction fees.\n\nThe core problem with this model is a value mismatch: the stablecoin itself creates value (providing the stability of its dollar peg), but the underlying blockchain captures value (collecting all transaction fees). This is like a gold mining company producing gold but having to share all profits from transportation, storage, and trading with a logistics company.\n\nThe deeper issue is dependency risk. When the Ethereum network is congested, USDT transfers become expensive and slow; when regulators put pressure on Ethereum, USDT is also affected. Nobel laureate in economics Oliver Hart, in his book \"The Theory of Incomplete Contracts,\" argues that when two entities are highly interdependent, the party with \"residual control\" gains a disproportionate bargaining advantage. In the blockchain ecosystem, the underlying protocol holds this residual control.\n\nThe traditional model also faces the problem of \"innovation constraints.\" General-purpose blockchains must cater to a wide range of use cases—DeFi, NFTs, gaming, storage, and more. This means they can't be deeply optimized for the specific needs of stablecoins, such as zero-fee transactions, regulatory compliance, and cross-border settlement. Just like you can't expect a Swiss Army knife to outperform a professional chef's knife at cutting vegetables.\n\n**Second, why might building your own blockchain be better?**\n\nBuilding your own blockchain transforms stablecoin issuers from \"tenants\" to \"landlords,\" achieving a complete value closure. Take Tether's dual-chain strategy, for example: Plasma focuses on deep integration with Bitcoin, while Stable provides zero-fee USDT transfers. This not only solves the cost issue but, more importantly, creates a \"defensive moat effect.\"\n\nCircle's Arc blockchain takes a different approach: tailoring it to the compliance needs of institutional clients. While traditional blockchains' one-size-fits-all design cannot meet the complex requirements of different regulatory jurisdictions, Arc offers built-in KYC/AML functionality, privacy options (hiding transaction amounts while retaining visible addresses), and uses USDC as its native transaction token. This design allows institutional clients to enjoy blockchain efficiency while meeting regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nEthena's Converge adopts a hybrid architecture: it combines a permissionless DeFi layer with a permissioned institutional layer. This design cleverly solves the \"impossible triangle\" of decentralization, compliance, and efficiency. Users can choose different ways to participate based on their needs: retail users can use the permissionless layer to enjoy DeFi innovations, while institutional clients can use the permissioned layer to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nFrom a network effect perspective, these specialized blockchains are creating \"vertically integrated network effects.\" Unlike Ethereum's \"horizontal network effect\" (more DeFi protocols benefit all), the vertical network effect is \"the more stablecoin transactions, the more valuable the stablecoin infrastructure becomes.\" Economist Brian Arthur, in his research on path dependence, found that vertically integrated network effects are often more stable than horizontal ones because they are less susceptible to disruption by cross-border competitors.\n\n**Third, why do most people misunderstand this trend?**\n\nThe biggest misconception is \"decentralization romanticism\"—the belief that all blockchains should be completely open, permissionless, public infrastructure. However, this idea ignores a reality: different application scenarios require different trust models. For DeFi speculative trading, full decentralization may be ideal; for large institutions' cross-border payments, controlled centralization may be more practical.\n\nVitalik Buterin recently wrote that \"decentralization\" is not a binary choice, but a spectrum. The key is not to pursue extreme decentralization, but to choose the right level of decentralization for a specific application. Stablecoin networks have chosen a model of \"centralized monetary policy, decentralized infrastructure,\" which may be more suitable for real-world needs than either complete decentralization or complete centralization.\n\nThe second misconception is zero-sum thinking—the belief that stablecoins building their own blockchains will \"kill\" general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum. However, the reality is likely to be a case of co-evolution: general-purpose blockchains focus on innovation and experimentation, while specialized blockchains focus on scalability and compliance. This is similar to how Apple's in-house chips didn't kill the semiconductor industry, but instead created a new division of labor.\n\nThe most profound misunderstanding stems from a misunderstanding of the nature of financial infrastructure. Many still view blockchains as \"technical projects,\" but in reality, they are becoming \"financial utilities.\" The logic of utilities isn't to pursue the most advanced technology, but rather the most reliable service. Electric companies won't just switch equipment simply because a new, cooler power generation technology becomes available; nor will financial infrastructure sacrifice stability and predictability for the sake of \"greater decentralization.\"\n\nBehavioral economist Daniel Kahneman has pointed out that when people judge complex systems, they often engage in \"availability bias\"—judging overall trends by the most easily recalled examples. When people think of blockchain, they often first think of Bitcoin's \"decentralized idealism\" or the \"innovative experiments\" of various DeFi projects, rather than the \"infrastructure-focused\" applications of stablecoins. This cognitive bias leads them to use a flawed framework to understand the logical development of stablecoin blockchains.\n\n**Philosophical Reflection: Decentralization and Recentralization of Power**\n\nReflecting on this trend, we discover an interesting paradox: while stablecoin issuers are \"decentralizing\" (weaning themselves from reliance on general-purpose blockchains) by building their own blockchains, they are also \"recentralizing\" (concentrating more control in their own hands). This reminds us that decentralization is never an absolute goal, but rather a means to achieve other goals (efficiency, censorship resistance, innovation, etc.).\n\nGerman philosopher Hegel's law of \"negation of the negation\" is embodied here: from centralized traditional finance to decentralized blockchains, and then to the \"selective recentralization\" of specialized blockchains. This is not a simple regression, but a synthesis at a higher level.\n\nPerhaps what truly matters is not the pursuit of perfect decentralization, but finding the optimal balance within given constraints. After all, the best system is often not the most perfect in theory, but the most feasible under real-world conditions. In this new era of digital currency, understanding the art of this balance may be more important than adhering to any single ideology.",
