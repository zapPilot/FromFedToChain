  "title": "History is always surprisingly similar: from Spanish silver coins to stablecoins, the \"digital colonialism\" behind the expansion of currency",
  "content": "Have you ever considered that when you trade USDC on a decentralized exchange, you might be reenacting a history that began 500 years ago? When Spanish silver (Real de a Ocho) flowed from the mines of the New World to the silk markets of China, when Roman silver dominated Mediterranean commerce, and when the British pound dominated global trade in the 19th century, these seemingly distant historical events bear a striking resemblance to today's expansion of stablecoins. History teaches us a profound truth: money has never been merely a tool for exchange; it has always been a vehicle for power. As the US Congress introduces the GENIUS Act, attempting to regulate stablecoins, we are witnessing a new era of \"digital colonialism\"—an expansion of monetary influence more rapidly, more covertly, and more comprehensively than any historical precedent. ## The Enlightenment of the Spanish Silver Dollar: The First Truly Global Currency Let's go back to 1565. When the first galleon, laden with Potosí silver, arrived at Manila Harbor, no one realized it would transform the entire world's economic landscape. The Spanish Silver Dollar, a silver coin weighing eight reals (Real de a Ocho), was about to become the first truly global currency in human history. **Technological Advantages Lay the Foundation** The Spanish Silver Dollar's success was no accident. It possessed the most advanced technical specifications of its time: a fixed weight (approximately 27 grams), a standardized silver purity (90.3%), and uniform casting standards. This standardization allowed merchants to quickly verify authenticity, significantly reducing transaction costs. More importantly, Spain possessed the world's richest silver mines at the time. The Potosí Silver Mine produced approximately half of the world's silver production at the time. This \"natural liquidity advantage\" gave Spanish silver coins a supply capacity unmatched by other currencies. **Penetration Model: From Trade Routes to Daily Life** The global expansion of the Spanish silver followed a clear pattern that is remarkably replicated in the expansion of stablecoins today: 1. **Penetration Phase**: First, it established influence in major trade ports such as Manila, Macau, and Nagasaki 2. **Integration Phase**: It became the preferred currency for cross-border trade, creating powerful network effects 3. **Institutionalization Phase**: It was formally or informally accepted by governments as a reserve and denomination currency 4. **Dependence Phase**: The local economy begins to rely on a stable supply of this foreign currency. During Ming Dynasty China, Spanish silver coins, even known as \"Falangji silver,\" became a crucial medium of exchange for private transactions. Chinese merchants at the time preferred silver coins from the distant New World to the imperially issued paper currency for a simple reason: the former was more reliable, more stable, and easier to use in international trade. Does this sound familiar? Today, Argentinians prefer USDC to pesos, Turks turn to stablecoins during periods of high inflation, and Nigerians use USDT for cross-border remittances—history is repeating itself digitally. ## Monetary Rule in the Roman Empire: The Perfect Combination of Power and Currency. If the Spanish denarius demonstrated the power of monetary globalization, then the Roman denarius (silver coin) exemplified how money could become a tool of political rule. **A Perfect Example of Institutionalization** The success of the Roman denarius rested not only on its metallic purity and weight standardization, but also on the Roman Empire's robust legal and administrative system. Roman law explicitly mandated that taxes be paid in Roman currency and that military salaries be paid in Roman currency. This \"enforced use\" created a stable foundation of demand. Even more astutely, the Roman Empire established mints in newly conquered territories, allowing locals to participate in the Roman monetary system. This not only reduced transportation costs but also tied local elites to Roman economic interests. **Modern Revelation: The Path to the Institutionalization of Stablecoins** Today's stablecoins are following a similar path. When El Salvador designated Bitcoin as legal tender, when the Swiss canton of Zug accepted digital currency for tax payments, and when a growing number of central banks began developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), we witnessed the institutionalization of digital currencies moving from the periphery to the center. This is the true significance of the GENIUS Act. It is not intended to suppress stablecoins, but to incorporate them into the US financial regulatory system, just as the Roman Empire incorporated its various monetary systems into the framework of Roman law. Once stablecoins gain formal legal status, they will transform from \"experimental digital tokens\" to \"regulated digital currencies,\" which will greatly accelerate their global adoption. ## The British Pound's Global Hegemony: How Sea Power Supports Monetary Power The British Pound's hegemony in the 18th and 19th centuries provides us with another important historical reference. The British Pound was able to become the global reserve currency at the time not only because of Britain's industrial revolution and economic strength, but also because of the \"security\" provided by the Royal Navy. **The key role of infrastructure** Britain not only controlled global trade routes, but also established the most advanced financial infrastructure in the world at that time. London's banking system, insurance market, and commodity exchange form a complete financial ecosystem. Merchants use the British pound not only because it is stable, but also because the entire set of financial services built around it is more complete and convenient. **Infrastructure Advantages in the Digital Age** Today's stablecoin expansion also relies on infrastructure advantages, but this time the infrastructure is digital: - **Blockchain Network**: Ethereum, Solana, etc. provide global settlement infrastructure - **DeFi Protocol**: Uniswap, Aave, etc. provide financial services around stablecoins - **Cross-chain Bridge**: Allow stablecoins to flow freely between different blockchains - **API**: Allowing traditional financial institutions to easily integrate stablecoin services. Just as 19th-century merchants relied on British shipping and financial networks, today's DeFi users rely on digital financial infrastructure centered on the US dollar stablecoin. Once this reliance is established, it is difficult to easily replace. ## German Mark's Penetration into Eastern Europe: Perhaps the most recent historical example that can best help us understand the current expansion of stablecoins is the rapid penetration of the German Mark into Eastern Europe in the 1990s. **Filling the Economic Vacuum** After the end of the Cold War, Eastern European countries faced a severe crisis of confidence in their currencies. Local currencies were unstable, inflation was severe, and the banking system was fragile. The German Mark, Western Europe's most stable currency, quickly filled this economic vacuum. In countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, the German Mark is not only used for high-value transactions (such as real estate and cars) but is also widely accepted in everyday life. Many stores display prices directly in German Marks, banks offer deposits in German Marks, and even wages may be partially paid in German Marks. **Modern Parallel: The Penetration of Stablecoins in Emerging Markets** The situation today is similar. In Argentina, with annual inflation exceeding 100%, people are converting their savings into USDC or USDT. In Turkey, the lira's wild fluctuations have made merchants more willing to accept stablecoins as payment. In Nigeria, the central bank's foreign exchange controls have made stablecoins the most convenient cross-border payment tool. Interestingly, the German mark ultimately did not \"colonize\" Eastern Europe. Instead, it was replaced by the euro, providing these countries with a \"higher level\" of monetary integration. This historical experience tells us that monetary penetration is not necessarily a zero-sum game and can sometimes evolve into a larger framework for cooperation. ## Summary of Historical Patterns: Four-Stage Currency Expansion Cycle By studying these historical cases, we can summarize a clear currency expansion pattern, which is being reproduced at an accelerated pace in the development of stablecoins: ### Phase 1: Infiltration **Historical Characteristics**: - Technological or institutional advantages provide competitiveness - First accepted in economically fragile regions - Mainly used for international trade or large-value transactions - Local governments may adopt a wait-and-see attitude or slightly resist **Current Status of Stablecoins (2020-2025)**: - Rapid adoption in countries with severe inflation (Argentina, Turkey) - Mainly used for DeFi, cryptocurrency trading, cross-border remittances - Governments around the world are cautious, and regulatory frameworks are not yet fully developed. - Total market capitalization has exceeded $150 billion, but remains primarily concentrated within the crypto ecosystem.### Phase 2: Integration **Historical Characteristics**: - Network effects begin to take effect - Becomes an important medium for cross-border trade - Local financial institutions begin to provide related services - Governments begin to seriously consider regulating or utilizing **Stablecoin Forecast (2025-2030)**: - Traditional financial institutions begin to integrate stablecoin services on a large scale - The proportion of stablecoin use in cross-border trade increases significantly - Major countries launch central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a competitive approach - International organizations begin to develop stablecoin regulatory standards### Phase 3: Institutionalization **Historical Characteristics**: - Government formally recognizes and incorporates it into the regulatory framework - Becomes part of the official reserve currency - Taxes and wages may be denominated in this currency - Establishes a complete legal and financial infrastructure **Stablecoin Forecast (2030-2035)**: - Some countries officially adopt the US dollar stablecoin as their official digital currency - Regulatory frameworks such as the GENIUS Act are promoted globally - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) may recognize the role of stablecoins in international reserves - The traditional banking system and stablecoins are deeply integrated### Phase 4: Overextension & Challenge **Historical Characteristics**: - Dominant currencies face internal problems (inflation, debt, political turmoil) - New technological or economic forces emerge - Other countries or regions launch alternatives - The cycle may restart **Stablecoin Forecast (after 2035)**: - The US dollar stablecoin may face challenges from changes in the US economy or policies - A multipolar digital currency system emerges (euro, renminbi, yen stablecoins) - New technological breakthroughs (such as central bank digital currencies) may change the rules of the game - A truly decentralized global digital currency may emerge## Acceleration factor: Why are cycles in the digital age faster? Historically, currency expansion cycles typically took centuries to complete, but the unique characteristics of the digital age could significantly accelerate stablecoin cycles: **1. Instantaneous Transmission** Ancient Spanish silver coins took months to reach Asia via galleons, and the British pound's international influence was gradually established through the physical banking network. But stablecoins can be transmitted to any corner of the world in seconds and can be used by anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone. **2. Programmability and Composability** Traditional currencies are merely a medium of exchange, but stablecoins are programmable. They can be integrated into smart contracts to automatically execute complex financial operations. This \"composability\" allows stablecoins to quickly penetrate into a variety of new application scenarios. **3. Exponential growth of network effects** The internet amplifies network effects. When a stablecoin is widely used in a certain DeFi protocol, it automatically becomes more attractive to other protocols, forming a powerful positive feedback loop. **4. Regulatory arbitrage and time windows** Stablecoins can quickly establish influence in multiple jurisdictions before regulators react. By the time governments begin to formulate regulatory policies, stablecoins may have already been deeply embedded in local economic activities, making prohibition difficult and costly. ## Resistance Models: How History Resists Monetary Colonialism History also teaches us that monetary expansion is not unstoppable. Successful resistance strategies have existed throughout history, and these strategies are equally instructive for combating \"digital colonialism\" today. **Lessons from the Roman Empire: Self-reliance is the foundation** The decline of Roman silver coins was not due to external attacks, but rather to internal currency devaluation. To meet military expenses and public expenditures, Roman emperors continuously reduced the silver content of silver coins, from 90% to 60%, and finally to 5%. When people discovered that Roman silver coins were no longer reliable, they naturally turned to other options. This lesson is crucial for central banks today: the best way to resist stablecoins is not to ban them, but to make their own currencies more stable and reliable. **China's Historical Wisdom: \"Treat others as they would have you treat yourself.\"** During the Ming and Qing dynasties, faced with the massive influx of foreign silver coins, China adopted a shrewd strategy: it didn't resist them, but insisted on recasting them using Chinese weights and measures. Foreign silver coins had to be recast according to Chinese standards before they could circulate in the market. This approach allowed China to enjoy the convenience of international trade while maintaining control over monetary standards. Today's Chinese Digital Currency (DCEP) strategy continues this approach: rather than completely rejecting digital currencies, it is launching its own central bank digital currency to compete. **Europe's Modern Experience: Collaboration in the Face of Hegemony** Faced with the hegemony of the US dollar, European countries chose to unite and create the euro. This \"banding together for warmth\" strategy has made the euro the second largest international reserve currency after the US dollar. Today we see similar trends: - China and Russia promote local currency settlement - Southeast Asian countries explore regional digital currency cooperation - African Union discusses unified African digital currency **Four strategies for successful resistance** Based on historical experience, strategies for successfully resisting foreign currency infiltration include: 1. **Technological parity**: Developing central bank digital currency with equivalent functions to stablecoins 2. **Institutional innovation**: Establishing a more efficient local digital payment system 3. **International cooperation**: Jointly developing alternatives with other countries 4. **Economic fundamentals**: Maintaining the credibility of the local currency through good monetary policies## Future scenarios: Three possible evolutionary paths Based on historical pattern analysis, there may be three main scenarios for the future development of stablecoins:### Scenario 1: Dominance of the US dollar stablecoin (Probability: 40%) **Features**: - USDC, USDT and other US dollar stablecoins become the de facto global digital reserve currencies - The GENIUS Act successfully establishes international regulatory standards - Most countries passively accept the dominance of the US dollar stablecoin in the digital economy - The US financial soft power is further strengthened **Conditions for realization**: - The US economy remains relatively stable - The CBDC development of other major economies lags behind - An international regulatory coordination mechanism is successfully established### Scenario 2: Multipolar digital currency system (Probability: 35%) **Features**: - The US dollar, euro, renminbi, and yen stablecoins coexist and compete - Different regions will form different spheres of digital currency influence - Cross-border trade will choose different digital currencies based on bilateral relations - A diversified pattern similar to today's foreign exchange market **Realization conditions**: - China's digital RMB is successfully internationalized - Europe's digital euro is well established - Geopolitics promotes currency de-dollarization### Scenario 3: Central bank digital currency counterattack (Probability: 25%) **Characteristics**: - CBDCs launched by major central banks successfully suppress private stablecoins - Governments regain control of monetary sovereignty and financial supervision - Stablecoins are restricted to specific niche markets - The international monetary system returns to a state-led model **Realization conditions**: - CBDC technology and user experience reach or exceed those of stablecoins - International regulatory cooperation effectively limits private stablecoins - Financial stability considerations prompt strong government intervention## Inspirations for individuals and businesses Understanding these historical patterns and future trends has important practical significance for each of us: **For individual investors**: - Do not put all assets in a single currency basket, including stablecoins - Pay attention to the development of central bank digital currencies, which may become an important alternative option - Learn to use multiple digital currencies and payment systems to avoid over-reliance **For business operators**: - Plan ahead for diversified digital payment solutions - Pay attention to regulatory changes to ensure compliance - Consider establishing a cross-regional asset allocation strategy **For policymakers**: - Actively develop domestic digital currency capabilities - strengthen international cooperation and avoid passively accepting foreign standards - find a balance between openness and control## Conclusion: Historical Echoes and Future Choices When we look back at the evolution of currency from Spanish silver to stablecoins, the most striking thing is not the technological advancement, but the consistency between human nature and the logic of power. Spanish merchants 500 years ago and today's DeFi users face the same economic incentive: to seek the most stable, convenient, and widely accepted medium of value storage and exchange. The expansion of stablecoins is not an accident, but an inevitable manifestation of economic laws. When traditional monetary systems fail to meet the demands of the digital age, new solutions will naturally emerge. The question is not whether to embrace this change, but how to protect one's interests and sovereignty within it. History teaches us that monetary hegemony is not eternal. Roman silver reigned for centuries before being replaced by Byzantine gold; Spanish silver dominated the world before ultimately giving way to the British pound; and the British pound dominated international trade for over a century before ultimately being surpassed by the US dollar. No monetary system is permanent. Today's expansion of stablecoins may be just the beginning of a larger transformation. Perhaps in the near future, we will see the full rise of central bank digital currencies, perhaps witness the emergence of a truly decentralized global digital currency, or perhaps experience an era of a multipolar digital currency system. But no matter how the future unfolds, one thing is certain: those individuals, companies, and countries who learn from history and adapt to change rather than resist it will reap the greatest benefits from this digital currency revolution. History doesn't simply repeat itself, but it rhymes. When we understand the inherent logic of monetary expansion, when we master the historical wisdom of resistance and adaptation, we can make wiser choices in this uncertain era. After all, as Mark Twain said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” In the story of stablecoins, we hear the echoes of history—both a warning and an opportunity.",
