  "title": "When Stable Currency Becomes a Financial Weapon: Arthur Hayes's View of the New Strategy of US Dollar Hegemony",
  "content": "Read Arthur Hayes' latest in-depth analysis today. The former BitMEX founder [Arthur Hayes is the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, known for his sharp macroeconomic analysis] has made another shocking claim: stablecoins may be the latest weapon the US uses to maintain its financial hegemony.\n\nIn his article, Hayes writes: \"Scott Bessent is attempting to use stablecoins to absorb $10-13 trillion in Eurodollar deposits and channel these funds into the US Treasury market.\"\n\n[Who is Scott Bessent? He is the new Treasury Secretary of the Trump administration, a former prominent hedge fund manager known as \"one of the brightest minds on Wall Street.\"]\n\nThis statement sounds technical, but Hayes thoroughly deconstructs the strategic intention behind it. What is the Eurodollar? [The Eurodollar is not the currency of Europe, but rather refers to US dollar deposits held in banks outside the United States, primarily in financial centers such as London, Singapore, and Tokyo.]\n\nThe core of the problem is this: although this money is US dollars, the US government has no real control over it. Hayes describes it as \"the unreachable reach of US monetary policy.\"\n\nBessent's solution is ingenious: by promoting stablecoins, he aims to \"bring\" these scattered US dollars back into the US financial system.\n\n\"Stablecoin issuers,\" Hayes writes, \"use a narrow banking model, investing US dollar reserves in short-term Treasury bills and earning a net interest margin.\"\n\n[What is a narrow bank?] This is a unique banking model that only invests customer deposits in the safest assets, such as government bonds, and cannot lend to businesses or individuals.\n\n[Net interest margin is the core of how banks make money: they borrow money at a low cost and lend it out at a high interest rate. The difference in interest rates is their profit.]\n\nThe ingenuity of this design lies in the fact that by holding USDC, users around the world are effectively providing unpaid financing to the US government. Users bear the exchange rate risk, but the interest income from the government bonds goes entirely to issuers like Circle.\n\nEven more astonishing is the marketing strategy. Hayes revealed, \"The US plans to distribute digital dollar accounts directly to users in the Global South through WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\"\n\n[The Global South refers to developing countries, primarily in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where financial infrastructure is relatively weak and demand for the US dollar is strong.]\n\nThis approach completely bypasses the traditional banking system and local government regulation. Hayes specifically pointed out a regulatory loophole: in many jurisdictions, stablecoins are classified as \"digital commodities\" rather than \"foreign exchange,\" and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange controls.\n\nTaking India as an example, Hayes noted: \"Under FEMA regulations, individuals holding foreign exchange must declare it, but holding USDC is legally considered a digital commodity transaction.\"\n\n[FEMA is India's Foreign Exchange Management Act, which strictly restricts foreign exchange transactions by individuals and businesses.]\n\nThis means that an engineer in Mumbai who thought he was \"speculating in cryptocurrencies\" has actually become an extension of US monetary policy.\n\nHayes made a bold prediction: \"By 2028, the circulation of stablecoins could reach $10 trillion.\" If this prediction comes true, it would be equivalent to the world providing the US government with $10 trillion in zero-cost financing.\n\nThis also explains why regulatory attitudes are shifting. Hayes observed, \"Neither the EU's MiCA regulation nor the framework being considered by the US aims to eliminate stablecoins, but rather to regulate and integrate them.\"\n\n[MiCA stands for the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.]\n\nBut Hayes' most profound insight lies in this: \"Many believe that stablecoins challenge the hegemony of the US dollar. This is completely the opposite. Stablecoins actually strengthen the hegemony of the US dollar.\"\n\nHis logic is this: the essence of financial power lies not in controlling the issuance of money but in controlling the demand for money. Stablecoins make using the US dollar cheaper and more convenient, effectively increasing global demand for it.\n\nHayes cited Nobel laureate in economics Robert Mundell's theory: \"Currency competitiveness depends on network effects and ease of use.\"\n\n[Robert Mundell is known as the \"father of the euro,\" and his optimal currency area theory explains why certain currencies become international reserve currencies.]\n\nFrom this perspective, stablecoins are amplifiers of the dollar's network effects. When the 1.4 billion unbanked people around the world access financial services through stablecoins, they believe they are using a \"decentralized currency,\" but in reality, they are still using the dollar—just a cheaper and more convenient version.\n\nHayes's conclusion is sharp: \"This so-called stablecoin revolution, while ostensibly a technological innovation, is actually an evolutionary upgrade of the US dollar's hegemony.\"\n\nBut Hayes doesn't stop at theoretical analysis; he offers concrete investment advice. In his view, since the US government is pushing this \"dollar co-optation,\" investors should identify projects that stand to benefit.\n\nHayes is particularly bullish on three DeFi projects: Ethena, Ether.fi, and Hyperliquid.\n\nRegarding Ethena, Hayes wrote: \"Ethena Labs' USDe is a synthetic dollar, stabilized by holding Ethereum and simultaneously shorting Ethereum futures. This design enables USDe to offer yields significantly higher than traditional stablecoins.\"\n\nUSDe's operating principle is ingenious: when you deposit ETH, Ethena uses that ETH as collateral and simultaneously shorts an equivalent amount of ETH in the futures market. This way, regardless of ETH price fluctuations, the overall value remains stable, while users can still earn ETH staking returns and futures market funding rates.\n\nHayes believes that USDe's innovation lies in: \"Unlike USDT or USDC, which rely on bank deposits, it creates a fully on-chain alternative to the US dollar while also sharing returns with holders.\"\n\nRegarding Ether.fi, Hayes's logic is: \"With Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, liquid staking has become a necessity. The eETH provided by Ether.fi allows users to earn staking returns while maintaining liquidity.\"\n\nLiquid Staking solves a core problem: traditional ETH staking requires locking up 32 ETH, and the funds are frozen. Ether.fi's eETH allows you to stake ETH and earn returns, while also receiving eETH tokens representing your staked shares, which are freely tradable on the market.\n\nThe most interesting offering is Hyperliquid. Hayes described it as \"a completely on-chain derivatives exchange, with no custodial risk, and all trades settled on-chain. In an era of frequent failures on centralized exchanges, this model represents the future.\"\n\nHyperliquid's revolutionary nature lies in the fact that traditional derivatives trading is either conducted on centralized exchanges (which carry custodial risk) or on complex DeFi protocols (which have high gas fees and slow speeds). Hyperliquid has built its own Layer 1 blockchain, specifically optimized for high-frequency derivatives trading.\n\nHayes's investment logic is straightforward: \"$ENA, $ETHFI, and $HYPE represent the future trend of stablecoins and DeFi infrastructure. When the US government begins to vigorously promote stablecoins, these protocols will be the biggest beneficiaries.\"\n\n[$ENA is Ethena's governance token, $ETHFI is Ether.fi's governance token, and $HYPE is Hyperliquid's native token.]\n\nHowever, Hayes also warned of risks. He wrote, \"USDe's model relies on funding rates in the futures market, which could expose it to unmooring risk under extreme market conditions. Investors need to understand the mechanics of these agreements and not blindly chase high prices.\"\n\nMore importantly, policy risks exist. Hayes observed, \"The Trump administration's stance on DeFi remains to be seen. While Bessent supports stablecoins, regulators may be more stringent about decentralized finance.\"\n\nHayes also mentioned an interesting detail: \"The U.S. Treasury is considering requiring stablecoin issuers to hold a certain percentage of U.S. Treasury bonds. This may seem like a technical adjustment, but in reality it is intended to ensure that global demand for stablecoins is directly converted into demand for U.S. Treasury bonds.\"\n\n[If implemented, this policy would mean that every time global users increase their stablecoin holdings by $1, a certain percentage would directly convert into demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, further reducing U.S. financing costs.]\n\nHayes's final verdict: \"This... This isn't financial innovation in the traditional sense, but rather a geopolitical currency war. Stablecoins are the new tool the US uses to maintain its financial hegemony, and DeFi protocols are the technological vehicle for this tool.\"\n\nHe emphasized the importance of timing: \"2025 could be a turning point in this trend. With the Trump administration and Bessent's policies, we will see the rapid establishment of a stablecoin regulatory framework and the large-scale adoption of related infrastructure.\"\n\nHayes's prediction sounds bold, but the logic is clear: the US government has recognized the strategic value of stablecoins and will use policies to promote global adoption. DeFi protocols that provide the relevant infrastructure will be the biggest beneficiaries of this financial restructuring.\n\nWhen we easily transfer USDC on our phones, we are actually participating in the largest monetary power restructuring of the 21st century. And the real game designers are quietly advancing this world-changing chess game in places we cannot see.",
