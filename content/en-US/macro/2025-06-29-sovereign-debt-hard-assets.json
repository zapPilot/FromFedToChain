      "title": "Sovereign Debt Crisis: Why Governments Are Reconsidering \"Hard Assets\"",
      "content": "Today let's talk about a topic that many people overlook, but could potentially affect everyone's wallet: the global government debt crisis.\n\nFirst, let's look at some numbers: US government debt has exceeded 120% of GDP, Japan's is as high as 260%, and even major European countries generally exceed 90%. What do these numbers mean? They mean that governments' fiscal space is rapidly shrinking.\n\nMore critically, this debt crisis is different from previous ones. In the past, governments could dilute debt through economic growth, but now all countries face the problems of aging populations and slowing productivity growth. Simply put, the speed of making money can't keep up with the speed of owing money.\n\nSo what will governments do? History tells us the answer is usually to print money. But this time, the money printing might be more covert. Central banks may maintain low interest rates for extended periods, allowing governments to borrow at very low costs. This is what economists call \"financial repression\" - artificially suppressing interest rates to reduce debt burden.\n\nThe question is, what's the cost of financial repression? It's the gradual erosion of purchasing power for those holding cash and bonds. If you keep money in the bank, interest rates might not even beat inflation. This is why we're seeing more and more institutional investors starting to allocate to \"hard assets.\"\n\nWhat are hard assets? They're assets that can't be arbitrarily printed by governments. Gold is the most traditional hard asset, but Bitcoin is becoming a new choice for the digital age. Its supply is fixed and won't increase due to government fiscal pressure.\n\nMost interestingly, we're starting to see some national governments also considering this logic. El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, partly hoping to counter the devaluation pressure of the US dollar. While this experiment is still ongoing, it raises an important question: in the age of sovereign debt crisis, do governments themselves also need hard assets to protect national wealth?\n\nFrom an investment perspective, the implications of this trend are clear. If governments are forced to implement more financial repression policies, traditional fixed-income investments may face long-term real negative returns. Conversely, scarce assets - whether gold, Bitcoin, or quality equity assets - may benefit from this environment.\n\nOf course, this process won't be linear. Governments will try various ways to maintain the existing system, including stricter capital controls and tax policies. But in the long run, mathematics is unforgiving: when debt growth exceeds economic growth, someone has to pay the bill.\n\nThe key is to understand that we may be entering an era where \"hard assets outperform soft assets.\" In this era, scarcity is not just an investment concept, but a necessity for countering systemic risk."
