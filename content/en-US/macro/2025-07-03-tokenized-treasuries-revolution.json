  "title": "The $600 billion digital bond revolution: When U.S. Treasury bonds move to the blockchain",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why an asset management giant like BlackRock would move U.S. Treasuries to the blockchain? This is not a technological stunt, but a profound change that is reshaping the global bond market. Today we are going to talk about an amazing phenomenon: the market for tokenized U.S. Treasuries has soared from almost zero to nearly $6 billion in just two years, growing 20 times faster than stablecoins. What is going on behind this?   BlackRock's BUIDL Fund: The Beginning of a New Era In March 2024, BlackRock launched the BUIDL Fund to tokenize U.S. Treasuries on the blockchain. This is not the first product of its kind, but it is the most successful one. By 2025, BUIDLâ€™s market cap is $2.5 billion, accounting for 41.1% of the entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market. Even more impressive is that this money is spread across seven different blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Solana. In comparison, Franklin Templetonâ€™s BENJI fund has a market cap of $707 million, and other players such as Ondo Finance are following quickly. The entire market presents a highly concentrated pattern with the top six funds accounting for 88% of the market share. What does this market structure reflect? Institutional investors attach great importance to compliance and brand trust. When you are managing billions of dollars in assets, the answer is obvious whether to choose BlackRock or an unknown DeFi protocol.   The Birth of a 24-Hour Global Bond Market The traditional U.S. Treasury market has a fundamental limitation: it is only open during U.S. trading hours. When Asian investors want to adjust their portfolio allocation, they have to wait until the U.S. market opens. Tokenization changes the rules of the game. Blockchain-based tokenized Treasuries provide a true 24/7 global market. A fund manager in Shanghai can adjust U.S. bond positions at 3 a.m. on weekends, just as if it were during New York trading hours. But the more important innovation lies in the concept of programmable money. Tokenized Treasuries are not just digitized bonds, they can be programmed to automatically execute complex financial logic. For example, a smart contract can be set to automatically switch the portfolio from short-term Treasuries to long-term Treasuries when the Fed cuts interest rates by 50 basis points. This automated asset allocation requires a lot of manual operations in the traditional financial system, but can now be completed in milliseconds.   The truth about the liquidity revolution Let's speak with data. Ethereum holds $4.3 billion in tokenized Treasuries, accounting for 72% of the total market. But what's really interesting is the difference in fund turnover. The average daily trading volume of the traditional Treasuries secondary market is about $600 billion, but most of it is large transactions between institutions. Although the total volume of tokenized Treasuries is smaller, its divisibility and 24-hour trading characteristics create unprecedented liquidity characteristics. A typical example: a DeFi protocol can use $1,000 of tokenized treasury bonds as collateral to immediately lend out $800 of stablecoins. The entire process does not require a credit check or bank approval, and is completely automatically executed by smart contracts. This \"atomic\" liquidity is unimaginable in the traditional financial world. It allows small investors to enjoy financial instruments that were only available to large institutions in the past.   Opportunity Window for China's Asset Management Industry For China's asset management companies, the tokenized treasury bond market provides unique opportunities. First of all, it is a new tool for global asset allocation. Chinese investors have long faced obstacles in overseas asset allocation: QDII quota restrictions, exchange rate risks, and time difference problems. Although tokenized treasury bonds cannot completely solve these problems, they provide more flexible operating tools. The second is the opportunity for  yield enhancement . The traditional yield of holding US treasury bonds is about 4.5%, but through the DeFi protocol, investors can use tokenized treasury bonds as collateral, participate in liquidity mining or lending protocols, and potentially obtain additional income. Of course, these opportunities are accompanied by new risks: smart contract risk, custody risk, and regulatory risk. But for those institutions that have the ability to manage these risks, this is a blue ocean market.   Window period for regulatory arbitrage The tokenized treasury bond market is currently in a golden period for regulatory arbitrage. There are significant differences in the regulatory attitudes towards such products in different jurisdictions. The US SEC regards tokenized Treasuries as digital representations of traditional securities, subject to existing securities regulations. The EU provides a relatively clear framework through the MiCA regulation. Many emerging market countries are still waiting and watching. This regulatory uncertainty creates short-term opportunities, but also lays long-term risks. Smart investors will use this window to build technical and market advantages while preparing for stricter regulation in the future.   The digital extension of US dollar hegemony From a macro perspective, the rise of tokenized US Treasury bonds is actually an extension of US dollar hegemony in the digital age. When investors around the world buy U.S. Treasuries through blockchain, they are actually strengthening the dollar's position as the global reserve currency. This forms an interesting contrast with the \"de-dollarization\" efforts promoted by central banks. Politically, countries want to reduce their dependence on the dollar, but technically, tokenization makes dollar assets more convenient and attractive. How will this contradiction be resolved? One possible development direction is that other major economies also launch their own tokenized sovereign bonds. Imagine if China launched a tokenized RMB Treasury bond, or the EU launched a tokenized ECB bond, what changes would happen to the global fixed income market?   Technical risks and systemic risks While we are excited about the innovation of tokenized treasury bonds, we cannot ignore its potential risks.  Smart contract risk : Tokenized treasury bonds rely on complex smart contracts, and any code loopholes may lead to capital loss.  Custody risk : Although treasury bonds are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the custody of tokenized treasury bonds is usually undertaken by a third-party institution, adding additional counterparty risk.  Liquidity risk : Under extreme market conditions, the liquidity of tokenized Treasury bonds may shrink sharply, especially in the case of blockchain network congestion.  Systemic risk : If the tokenized Treasury market continues to grow rapidly, it may have an impact on the traditional bond market and affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.   Outlook for the next decade If the tokenized Treasury market continues to grow at its current rate, it may reach a scale of US$100 billion by 2030. This will have a far-reaching impact on the global financial system.  Evolution of central bank policy tools : The Fed may need to consider the impact of tokenized Treasury bonds on monetary policy transmission, and even develop policy tools specifically for tokenized assets.  Reconstruction of financial infrastructure : Traditional financial infrastructure such as clearing houses, custodian banks, and rating agencies will face challenges from blockchain-native alternatives.  Opportunities in emerging markets : Countries with relatively backward financial infrastructure may skip the traditional financial system and directly adopt blockchain-based financial services.   Conclusion: A turning point in history We are standing at a turning point in the history of the fixed income market. Tokenized Treasury bonds are not only a technological innovation, but also a manifestation of the redistribution of financial power. For Chinese investors and financial institutions, this is both an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity lies in being able to participate in the forefront of global financial innovation, and the challenge lies in how to find a balance in regulatory uncertainty. The future winners will be those participants who can grasp technological trends and manage emerging risks. In this era of digital transformation, conservatism may be the biggest risk.",
