  "content": "Have you ever thought about what happened when the most conservative money in the world began to flee like crazy?\n\nToday we are going to talk about a topic that many people are reluctant to face: how to protect wealth in war and turmoil. This is not alarmist, but a question that every person with assets should think deeply about.\n\n## Why didn't the buried treasures save them?\n\nLet me tell you a story first. During the Cultural Revolution, there was a collector in Shanghai who saw the situation change and quickly buried all the precious porcelain in his home in the backyard. He thought that it was hard assets anyway, and it was better to bury them than to have the house confiscated.\n\nWhat was the result? The Red Guards still found it, and the porcelain was broken all over the floor. What‚Äôs worse is that this collector was criticized for ‚Äúhiding feudal cultural relics‚Äù and his family was destroyed.\n\nBut at the same time, another family made a different choice. The father of this family was an intellectual. Although he was also persecuted, he secretly taught his children mathematics, foreign languages, and philosophy at home. He told his children: \"The house can be raided, the money can be confiscated, but no one can take away the knowledge and character in your mind.\"\n\nThirty years later, guess what the result was? The first family completely fell into decline, while the descendants of the second family, some became scholars, and some went abroad to recreate wealth.\n\nThis is the first insight I want to share with you today: **The highest form of wealth is not gold and real estate, but the inheritance of intangible capital. **\n\n## Do you think gold is a safe haven? History tells you the truth\n\nMany financial advisors will tell you that buying gold and real estate are \"hard assets\" that can resist inflation and maintain value. But what they don't tell you is that these assets are only \"hard\" under the framework of a stable rule of law.\n\nWhen the political system collapses or becomes authoritarian, your \"hard assets\" may become your \"target\". Why? Because they are too conspicuous!\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, 250,000 households in Shanghai alone were searched. The Red Guards specifically looked for \"four types of elements\" who had houses and land. No matter how deep your gold bars are hidden or how strictly you collect the house deeds, you will eventually not escape the search.\n\nThis reminds me of a modern example. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2022, Western countries directly froze the overseas assets of Russian oligarchs. Billions of dollars of luxury homes, yachts, and artworks turned into waste paper overnight.\n\nTherefore, hard assets are not \"hard\" in all situations. **The nature of the crisis determines the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. **\n\n## Hong Kong's financial defense war: the government defended the exchange rate, but your stocks still fell in half\n\nIn the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong taught us a wonderful lesson.\n\nAt that time, international speculators used the \"double strike\" tactic: shorting the Hong Kong dollar on one side and shorting Hong Kong stocks on the other. Their logic was to force the Hong Kong government to either maintain the exchange rate or the stock market, and neither could be maintained.\n\nHow did the Hong Kong government fight back? Directly use 80 billion US dollars of foreign exchange reserves to raise the overnight lending rate to 280%! Want to short the Hong Kong dollar? Sure, the borrowing cost is so high that you will go bankrupt. At the same time, the government directly entered the market to buy stocks, squeezing out the speculators.\n\nFinal result: The Hong Kong dollar was saved and the financial system was stable. Sounds successful, right?\n\nBut what about individual investors? The Hang Seng Index still fell by 60%, housing prices were cut in half, and GDP shrank by 5.5%.\n\nThis is the second insight I want to tell you: **The government can hold the exchange rate, but it can't hold your house prices and stock market value. **Systemic stability does not mean the safety of personal assets.\n\n## True diversification is not just about changing a few baskets\n\nWhen it comes to diversification, most people think of stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, and just buy a few of them.\n\nBut true diversification is much more complicated. You need to diversify not only the asset categories, but also:\n\n**Geographic location**: All assets cannot be in one country, but it is not enough to have overseas assets. You also need to ensure that you can use them when you need them. During the Cultural Revolution, some families had assets overseas, but they were completely unable to use them.\n\n**Wealth form**: In addition to financial assets, you also need human capital (skills, education), social capital (connections, relationships), and cultural capital (values, wisdom). These are often the most resilient.\n\n**Accessibility**: It is not about where the assets are, but whether you can quickly cash in, transfer, and use them in times of crisis.\n\n**Control**: Are you the owner of the asset, or just the beneficiary? In extreme cases, this distinction can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nFor example, why is Bitcoin called \"digital gold\" in some circles? Not only because of its scarcity, but more importantly because of its \"portability\" and \"autonomous custody\". You can keep the private key in your mind and cross any border without any third-party permission.\n\nBut at the same time, it also has technical and regulatory risks. There is no perfect asset, only a relatively optimized combination.\n\n## The most important lesson: When to start preparing?\n\nBack to the question at the beginning: When to start preparing for wealth protection?\n\nMost people's answer is: \"Wait until there is a real danger.\"\n\nBut history tells us a cruel truth: **When you think \"it's not time to leave yet\", it may be the last moment you have a choice. **\n\nDuring World War II, there was a Jewish family, half of whom went to Portugal and half stayed in France. Their idea was: \"It won't be that bad, we have lived here for generations.\"\n\nAs a result, those who went to Portugal survived, and those who stayed in France were sent to concentration camps.\n\nBefore the Asian financial crisis, how many people thought of preparing for foreign exchange hedging? Hong Kong's successful defense is largely because they have accumulated sufficient foreign exchange reserves in peacetime.\n\n## Survival wisdom in turbulent times\n\nFinally, I would like to share a deep insight: **Turbulence is the norm, and peace is the exception. **\n\nWe are used to the thinking mode of peacetime and think that the current order will last forever. But if you look at it from a long-term historical perspective, war, revolution, and economic crisis are the norm of human society.\n\nThe real protection of wealth is not to prepare for a specific crisis, but to build an \"anti-fragile\" ability.\n\nThis ability includes:\n- Maintaining diversified options\n- Cultivating the ability to learn and adapt quickly\n- Building a trusted interpersonal network\n- Maintaining sensitivity to environmental changes\n- Most importantly, passing on the correct values and ways of thinking to the next generation\n\nRemember, in the long river of history, the families that can cross turbulence and pass on from generation to generation have never relied on a specific asset, but a wisdom and character that can cope with changes.\n\nYour wealth needs to be spread not only in different baskets, but also in different countries, different forms, and even in your own mind and network.\n\nBecause in the end, what can protect you is not what you have, but who you are and who you can become.",
