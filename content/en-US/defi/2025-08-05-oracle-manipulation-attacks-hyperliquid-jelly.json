  "title": "When messengers become weapons: How oracle manipulation attacks redefine DeFi security boundaries",
  "content": "In ancient Greek mythology, Hermes was the messenger of the gods, responsible for delivering messages between heaven and earth. This messenger's duties seemed simple: faithfully convey information without addition, deletion, or distortion. But what would happen if someone discovered they could bribe this messenger to deliver false oracles? The entire world, relying on oracles for decision-making, would be thrown into chaos by a corrupted messenger.\n\nIn the world of DeFi, oracles are such messengers. They are responsible for transmitting price information from the external world to the blockchain, allowing smart contracts to make decisions based on real market data. But the JELLY token attack on the Hyperliquid platform in March 2025 showed us all: when messengers are weaponized, a $12 million disaster unfolds.\n\nImagine you're a watchmaker in a small town. Every morning, you rely on the town's single clock to set the watches of all your customers. This clock gets its time from three sources: the train station chime, the church bells, and the town hall clock. For years, this system worked well, as these three sources verified each other, ensuring accurate time. But one day, a clever scammer took control of both the train station and church clocks, causing them to display the wrong time. The result? The entire town's time system was distorted, and you, the watchmaker, unknowingly \"corrected\" the incorrect time on all your customers' watches.\n\nOn the surface, the JELLY attack was a price manipulation operation targeting low-liquidity tokens. However, the real problem is that DeFi protocols have systemic flaws in their trust in external data sources, which are amplified when liquidity dries up.\n\nFirst, how does oracle price aggregation typically work?\n\nMost DeFi protocols employ a similar price discovery mechanism: collecting price data from multiple exchanges and then calculating a \"fair price\" using a median or weighted average. The design logic of this mechanism is statistical: assuming that most data sources are honest, mathematical methods can filter out a small number of outliers.\n\nTake Hyperliquid as an example. Its mark price calculation formula is: Mark Price = Median(Price1, Price2, Last Traded Price). Price1 is the index price plus a funding rate adjustment, and Price2 is the index price plus a moving average basis. The index price itself is a weighted average of multiple spot exchanges. This complex calculation appears scientific and secure.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the security of this system is entirely based on a single assumption: that the data sources are sufficient, independent, and difficult to manipulate. This assumption generally holds true for mainstream assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But for a small cryptocurrency like JELLY, with daily trading volume of less than $2 million and extremely thin liquidity on several key exchanges, this assumption completely breaks down.\n\nThe attackers exploited this very fact. They discovered that simply by simultaneously buying JELLY on several illiquid exchanges, they could cause the price to surge by 500% in a short period of time. Hyperliquid's oracle system faithfully records this manipulated price and uses it as the \"true market price\" to trigger liquidations.\n\n**Second, what constitutes a good oracle design?**\n\nA truly secure oracle system should have multiple layers of protection, not just relying on mathematical aggregation algorithms.\n\nFirst, an outlier detection mechanism. When a price data deviates from the historical average by more than a certain threshold, the system should automatically flag it as suspicious and reduce its weight in the final calculation. For example, if the price of JELLY suddenly jumps from $0.008 to $0.05, an increase of over 500%, the system should recognize this as a possible manipulation.\n\nNext, time-weighting and volatility adjustment should be considered. Instead of allowing momentary price fluctuations to immediately influence critical decisions, short-term anomalies should be smoothed out using the time-weighted average price (TWAP). Furthermore, for illiquid assets, more conservative liquidation parameters and longer price confirmation windows should be set.\n\nEven more importantly, dynamic risk management is crucial. The system should dynamically adjust its risk parameters based on the liquidity of assets. For smaller coins like JELLY, maximum leverage should be limited, additional safety margins should be added, and stricter position monitoring mechanisms should be implemented.\n\nDecentralized oracle networks like Chainlink and Python have made significant improvements in this regard. They not only utilize more data sources but also introduce reputation mechanisms and economic incentives to incentivize data providers to provide accurate information.\n\n**Third, why do most protocols make mistakes in oracle design?**\n\nThe root of this problem lies in three cognitive biases: technological optimism, illusion of scale, and risk externalization.\n\nTechnological optimism led developers to believe that sufficiently sophisticated algorithms could solve all trust issues. They were enchanted by the elegance of mathematical models, but overlooked the complexity of the real world. The median algorithm, while appearing perfect in textbooks, proved vulnerable to coordinated attacks.\n\nThe illusion of scale led protocol teams to mistakenly believe that mechanisms that worked in Bitcoin would also work in altcoins. They observed the deep order books of major exchanges and assumed that all assets had similar liquidity distributions. In reality, liquidity distribution for long-tail assets is extremely uneven, allowing a few key exchanges to dictate price trends.\n\nMost fatally, risk externalization occurs. When protocols design liquidation mechanisms, they often shift the ultimate risk to liquidity providers or insurance funds. In the case of Hyperliquid, the HLP vault ultimately bears the attacker's losses. This design leaves the protocol itself with little incentive to improve risk controls, as if problems arise, the losses are borne by others.\n\nThe underlying reason is that the DeFi industry remains mired in a \"technology first\" mindset. Everyone competes for the most advanced algorithms, fastest transaction times, and highest capital efficiency, but few are willing to invest time in considering risk management in extreme scenarios. After all, designing complex risk control mechanisms is neither sexy nor likely to attract market attention. From a game theory perspective, this is a classic \"tragedy of the commons.\" Every protocol seeks to maintain its competitive advantage, so it strives to minimize friction and maximize efficiency, with risk management often viewed as a \"necessary evil.\" It wasn't until attacks like the JELLY attack that people realized that an efficient system without a sufficient safety margin can ultimately be the most inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion: Finding a Balance Between Trust and Verification**\n\nRussian writer Dostoyevsky once said, \"If God does not exist, then everything is permitted.\" In the world of DeFi, we can understand this: if the oracle is untrustworthy, the entire system's security assumptions collapse.\n\nThe JELLY attack reminds us that technological advancement cannot replace a deep understanding of human nature. No matter how sophisticated an algorithm is, it cannot completely eliminate human greed and cunning. True security comes not only from perfect code but also from a deep understanding of attacker psychology and thorough preparation for extreme scenarios.\n\nPerhaps we need to acknowledge a less sexy but more realistic truth: in a decentralized world, complete automation and complete security may conflict with each other. The best systems are not those that claim to handle everything automatically, but those that know when to intervene at critical moments.\n\nAs we pursue more efficient and automated financial systems, perhaps we should occasionally pause and ask ourselves: Are we building a better world, or are we preparing bigger prey for clever attackers? This question has no definitive answer, but it deserves deep reflection from everyone involved in DeFi.",
