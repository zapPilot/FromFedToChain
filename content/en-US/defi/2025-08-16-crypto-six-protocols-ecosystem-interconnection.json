  "title": "Six Crypto Protocols: When Financial Lego Becomes a Digital City, You Need Ecosystem Thinking",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why McDonald's doesn't just sell burgers; it's also become the world's largest real estate company? Why doesn't Apple just make phones but also build the vast ecosystem of the App Store? In the business world, true winners are never built on a single product, but rather on a system of interdependent, mutually reinforcing products. Now, this principle applies to the world of cryptocurrency as well.\n\nImagine you're planning a brand new city. You can't just build a bank; you need roads, electricity, shopping malls, and housing‚Äîeach component must seamlessly connect with the others. Lately, the industry has been focusing on the \"six crypto protocols\"‚ÄîPendle, Aave, Ethena, Ethereum, HyperEVM, and Bitcoin‚Äînot for their individual strengths, but for how interconnected they are. It's like observing the value of a city: it lies not in the opulence of its individual buildings, but in the cohesion of the entire urban plan.\n\n**On the surface, this discussion is about six different crypto protocols; in reality, it's about exploring a fundamentally new way of thinking about financial infrastructure‚Äîfrom isolated institutions to composable ecosystems.**\n\n## First, how does DeFi typically work?\n\nTraditionally, we approach DeFi by studying each protocol one by one. Just like learning about a city, we first understand how banks operate, then how exchanges operate, and finally try to understand the relationship between them. However, this approach misses the most revolutionary aspect of DeFi.\n\nLet's reframe these six protocols from the perspective of a \"digital financial city\":\n\nEthereum is the city's infrastructure‚Äîits roads, electricity, and legal system. Without it, nothing else can function. Ethereum currently controls over 60% of the DeFi total value locked (TVL), equivalent to the city's primary economic sector.\n\nAave is the city's central bank‚Äîit controls over 60% of the Ethereum lending market, with a total locked-up value of nearly $50 billion. When you need liquidity, you go to Aave; when you want leverage, you go to Aave again. It doesn't set monetary policy, but it serves as the central hub for credit flows throughout the ecosystem.\n\n**Pendle is the city's derivatives exchange**‚Äîit does something cool: it separates \"future returns\" from assets and turns them into tradable commodities. Imagine owning a goose that lays golden eggs. Pendle allows you to sell the goose itself and the rights to future golden eggs separately. Currently, Pendle manages over $6 billion in assets, a 2,000% increase.\n\n**Ethena is the city's money printer**‚Äîbut it doesn't print traditional money. Instead, it creates \"synthetic dollars\" (USDe) through a complex hedging strategy. Its market capitalization has exceeded $9 billion, making it the world's third-largest stablecoin, and it maintains its peg to the US dollar through an AI-enhanced hedging model.\n\nHyperEVM is the highway connecting different cities‚Äîin a multichain world, it ensures interoperability between blockchains.\n\nBitcoin is the city's gold reserve‚Äîindependent, stable, and a value anchor. While not directly involved in daily economic activities, it provides a foundation of confidence for the entire system.\n\nIn \"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School noted that revolutionary innovation often comes from systemic restructuring rather than improvements to individual components. This is precisely the case with DeFi‚Äîits power derives from the composability of these protocols.\n\n## Second, what is the best approach?\n\nA better way to understand these six protocols is to think of them as an organic ecosystem, just as understanding a person's health requires looking not at individual organs but at the coordination between them.\n\nLet me illustrate this ecosystem approach with a concrete example of money flows:\n\nSuppose you have 1 ETH, worth approximately $3,000. In this digital financial city, one ETH can be used in multiple \"areas\" simultaneously:\n\n1. **On Ethereum**, you can stake your ETH to earn stETH and start earning a base yield of approximately 4%.\n\n2. **Obtaining Ethena**, you can use stETH to mint USDe, obtaining stable value while maintaining yield exposure.\n\n3. **Deposit it in Aave**, using USDe as collateral to borrow more assets and create leverage.\n\n4. **Through Pendle**, you can decompose stETH into a principal token (PT) and a yield token (YT), trading future returns based on market expectations.\n\nThese aren't four separate operations, but rather a continuous chain of value creation. Each step amplifies the effects of the previous one, creating capital efficiency unavailable to traditional financial institutions.\n\nIn his book The Nature of the Firm, Nobel laureate Ronald Coase proposed the \"transaction cost theory\"‚Äîthe idea that when coordination costs between different economic entities decrease, more complex but more efficient forms of economic organization emerge. The composability of DeFi is the perfect digital embodiment of this theory: smart contracts drive transaction costs between different protocols to near zero, enabling the creation of an unprecedented portfolio of financial products.\n\nHowever, this interconnectedness also introduces new risks. With Ethena's USDe supply exceeding $9 billion, a significant portion of which is held as collateral on Aave, problems on any one side can impact the entire ecosystem. This is like the 2008 financial crisis‚Äîostensibly a mortgage crisis, but in reality, a systemic risk stemming from the over-interconnectedness of the entire financial system.\n\n## Third, why do most people get it wrong?\n\nMost people make a fundamental mistake when understanding DeFi: they interpret DeFi's \"protocol thinking\" through the lens of traditional finance's \"institutional thinking.\"\n\nTraditional finance is \"fortress-like\": each bank and exchange is an independent castle with its own moat, competing more than cooperating. Citibank's system doesn't connect directly to JPMorgan Chase's; they interact indirectly through the central bank's clearing system.\n\nDeFi is \"Lego-like\": each protocol is designed to seamlessly integrate with other protocols. Aave's lending can be directly linked to Pendle's yield split, while Ethena's stablecoin can be instantly used in any other protocol. This isn't accidental, but a deliberate design philosophy.\n\nThis difference leads to three common misconceptions:\n\n**Misconception 1: A high APY equals a good protocol**. In reality, a protocol's value lies not in how high its returns are, but in how many other protocols it can be combined with to create new financial products. Pendle's value isn't its TVL, but in the new transaction dimension of \"time\" it adds to the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Misconception 2: Assuming stability equals security**. In a highly interconnected system, \"stability\" can be synonymous with \"fragility.\" While Ethena's USDe maintains a dollar peg, the hedging mechanism it relies on can fail under extreme market conditions, yet it has become deeply integrated into the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Misconception 3: Decentralization equals risk-free**. However, composability creates a new kind of centralization‚Äînot the centralization of power, but the centralization of dependency. When most DeFi protocols rely on Aave to provide liquidity, Aave becomes a systemically important \"too big to fail\" institution.\n\nComplexity scientist Stuart Kauffman once said, \"In complex systems, the behavior of the whole cannot be predicted from the behavior of its individual components.\" This is precisely the nature of the DeFi ecosystem‚Äîit creates new possibilities unimaginable in traditional finance, but also introduces new risks that we are still learning to understand.\n\n--\n\nWhen we talk about the \"Six Protocols of Crypto,\" we are actually witnessing the birth of a new financial paradigm‚Äîfrom institutionalized closed systems to protocol-based open networks. This transition is as significant as the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, or from a closed network to the open internet.\n\nBut as philosopher Nassim Taleb said, \"The problem with complex systems is that you never know where the next surprise will come from.\" While embracing the enormous opportunities that this composability presents, we must also maintain humility and recognize that we may not yet fully understand the full implications of this new system. After all, when money began to redefine its boundaries, we were all still students.",
