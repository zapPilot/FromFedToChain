  "title": "When Utopia Meets Reality: Why Does Decentralized Web3 Still Need Centralization as a Crutch?",
  "content": "In his The Republic, Plato envisioned a perfect city-state, where everyone fulfilled their responsibilities and society functioned in perfect order. But more than two thousand years later, we still haven't achieved that ideal state. This isn't because Plato's design was flawed, but because the real world is too complex and human nature too difficult to change. The story of Web3 is, in essence, a story about ideals and reality.\n\nWe all know that blockchain technology was originally intended to eliminate single points of failure and establish a fully decentralized financial world. However, on an ordinary weekday in July 2024, when data infrastructure provider Goldsky experienced a six-hour outage, much of the DeFi ecosystem was paralyzed. Users couldn't see their holdings when they opened Uniswap; they couldn't access the latest forecast data when they opened Polymarket; and countless applications appeared to be completely inoperable on the front end. It was like a supercomputer that boasted never-stopping functionality, but was completely paralyzed by a single power outlet.\n\nOn the surface, this was a service outage caused by a technical glitch. But the real problem is this: while Web3 achieves decentralization at the blockchain level, it has recreated single-point dependency at the application level. This dependency isn't accidental; it's the inevitable result of a combination of economic incentives, user experience, and technical complexity.\n\nFirst, how is data retrieval typically performed in Web3?\n\nImagine you're running a library. Every day, readers ask, \"What books are written by X?\" or \"Can you list all books about blockchain?\" If you forced readers to search through every book in the library to find the answer, no one would want to visit. So you need an indexing system—catalogs organized by author, by subject, by publication year, and so on.\n\nWeb3 data retrieval works in this way. Data on the blockchain is public, and theoretically, anyone can run a node and access it. However, when you want to know \"how much liquidity do I have on Uniswap\" or \"which DeFi protocols does this wallet address participate in,\" querying the blockchain directly is as inefficient as searching through an entire library.\n\nTake a loan agreement, for example: the contract doesn't allow a user to directly query all of their positions using a user address. Instead, it only provides a function to query position details using a position ID. To display all of a user's positions on the front-end, it would theoretically require searching all positions in the system and then filtering out those belonging to that user. This process, even when directly calling a local node on the server, can often take hours to complete.\n\nMost DeFi applications employ a similar architecture: the front-end interface sends query requests to data indexing services (such as Goldsky and The Graph) via APIs. These services have already pre-processed and organized the blockchain data, quickly returning the information users need. This system works well under normal circumstances, but it introduces a fatal weakness: centralized dependency.\n\nSecond, why is The Graph's dream of decentralization so difficult to achieve?\n\nThe ideal Web3 data infrastructure should be like the internet itself—with no single point of failure while providing an excellent user experience. The Graph Protocol represents the most ambitious decentralization effort, but reality is far more complex than theory.\n\nLet's use a concrete example to understand how it works: Imagine you want to deploy a subgraph that queries Uniswap transaction data. First, you need to write a program in AssemblyScript that defines how to extract and process data from Uniswap contract events. Then, you deploy this subgraph to The Graph Network. But here comes the first obstacle: no one will automatically index your subgraph.\n\nThis requires you to perform \"curation,\" which involves staking a certain amount of GRT tokens to your subgraph. This action effectively signals to the market, \"My subgraph is valuable and worth servicing!\" The more GRT you stake, the higher the signal on the bond curve for your subgraph, attracting the attention of indexers.\n\nBased on community experience, you need to stake at least 5,000 to 10,000 GRT to ensure that several indexers are willing to serve your subgraph. At current prices, this means an initial investment of several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, and this investment also carries the risk of GRT price fluctuations.\n\nOnce an Indexer starts serving your subgraph, the fee for each API query is distributed as follows: 1% is directly destroyed, approximately 10% goes to the curation pool (that is, you and other curators), and the remaining approximately 89% is distributed according to a complex mathematical formula to the Indexer and its delegates who provided the computing power.\n\nSounds perfect, right? But the reality is harsh. Developers have discovered that the entire process is not only complex but also full of uncertainty. You don't know how long it will take for an Indexer to join, what the service quality will be like, and how query fees will fluctuate. For developers accustomed to the \"register-pay-use\" model, the learning curve and psychological burden of this system are too high.\n\nEven more serious is the cost calculation problem. With traditional SaaS services, you can easily budget for monthly API call fees. But with The Graph, your costs depend on the market price of GRT, query demand on the network, competition among indexers, and a complex revenue distribution algorithm. This makes financial planning nearly impossible.\n\nCorporate accounting departments are even more bewildered. They're used to accounting for items like \"software service fees\" or \"API usage fees,\" but when it comes to \"token economic participation fees,\" \"curation staking costs,\" and \"query token expenses,\" they have no idea how to categorize and account for them. Imagine your CFO asks you, \"How much did you spend on The Graph this month?\" How would you explain GRT price fluctuations, curation revenue, query fee sharing, and a whole host of other concepts?\n\n**Third, why do most developers \"turn\" to centralized solutions?**\n\nThe core of this issue lies in three cognitive biases: idealism, fear of complexity, and the illusion of risk transfer.\n\nThis idealism leads many Web3 advocates to believe that as long as the technology achieves decentralization, the market will naturally adopt the solution. However, they ignore a harsh reality: developers faced with time pressure and budget constraints will always choose the path of least resistance. When Goldsky offers a traditional SaaS pricing model—\"sign up, link a credit card, and pay as you go\"—developers don't have to consider the complexities of token economics.\n\nComplexity phobia can lead developers to shy away from any system that adds cognitive load. Imagine being forced to learn the following concepts when you simply want to query some Uniswap transaction data:\n\n- **Curator**: A person who predicts which subgraphs will be widely used by staking GRT.\n- **Indexer**: A service provider who runs a node and processes queries, and must stake at least 100,000 GRT.\n- **Delegator**: An investor who delegates GRT to an Indexer in exchange for a share of the revenue.\n- **Bond Curve**: The mathematical mechanism that determines the costs and rewards of curation.\n- **Slashing**: A mechanism that penalizes Indexers for providing incorrect data.\n\nThis isn't the complexity of programming; it's the complexity of business and finance. For most technical teams, learning these concepts is as absurd as asking someone who wants to buy coffee to understand how the coffee bean futures market works.\n\nThe most dangerous is the illusion of risk transfer. Many projects believe that choosing a decentralized infrastructure transfers risk, but in reality, they are simply exchanging one risk for another. The Graph's decentralization does avoid the technical risk of a single point of failure, but it introduces token price risk, network congestion risk, and uncertain service quality. In contrast, Goldsky's centralized approach, while still subject to downtime risk, is predictable and manageable—at least you know who to contact if problems arise.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective, this is a classic \"Tragedy of the Commons\" scenario. Every developer seeks to maintain a competitive advantage, so they choose tools with the lowest learning curve and fastest onboarding. When Goldsky offers a \"sign up today, use tomorrow\" experience, while The Graph requires you to \"buy tokens, learn the concepts, wait for the indexer, and then pray for service stability,\" the market choice becomes clear.\n\n**Conclusion: Finding a Balance Between Ideals and Reality**\n\nGerman sociologist Max Weber once said, \"Politics is the slow, difficult work of drilling holes into a hard board.\" The same is true of the development of Web3. We can't expect to build a completely decentralized utopia overnight, nor should we abandon the ideal of decentralization because of the complexities of reality.\n\nThe Graph's story shows us that decentralization isn't just a technical issue; it's also a user experience issue. Even the most perfectly designed token economics won't achieve mass adoption unless they're translated into a developer-friendly experience.\n\nPerhaps we need to acknowledge a less romantic but more practical truth: the best decentralized systems aren't those that reject any centralized elements from day one, but rather those that leave users with choice. Hybrid models like Ponder—open source tools and optional hosting services—allow developers to choose the appropriate infrastructure for their development stage.\n\nThe Goldsky outage is a painful but necessary lesson. It reminds us that in the pursuit of convenience, we must not neglect the importance of resilience. A truly mature Web3 infrastructure should combine the ease of use of Goldsky, the censorship resistance of The Graph, and the freedom of choice of Ponder.\n\nAs we pursue a more decentralized world, perhaps we should occasionally pause and ask ourselves: Are we building a more practical system or proving the correctness of a theory? The answer is probably both, but the order is important. First make the system practical, then make it ideal. This process may not be as pure, but it is definitely more realistic.",
