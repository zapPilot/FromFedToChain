  "title": "When DeFi protocols learn to “transform”: Why are Uniswap and Aave transforming from Lego bricks back into “super applications”?",
  "content": "The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, \"The only constant in the world is change itself.\" 2,500 years later, this statement has found its most vivid expression in the blockchain world. If you closely observe the development of DeFi (decentralized finance), you'll discover a fascinating phenomenon: the most successful protocols undergo a cycle of specialization, modularization, and reintegration. This is no accident; it adheres to the fundamental laws of technological evolution. Just like biological evolution, DeFi protocols are constantly adapting their \"survival strategies\" under the pressure of survival of the fittest.\n\nImagine your friend Xiao Chen, a financial analyst working in Singapore, who has recently begun to pay attention to DeFi investments. He noticed a strange phenomenon: In 2018, Uniswap was just a simple token exchange platform, like a small street money exchange. By 2021, it had become an open \"financial Lego,\" allowing any developer to build applications on it. But now, in 2025, Uniswap has launched its own wallet, its own blockchain, Unichain, and even its own aggregator, Uniswap X. Xiao Chen asked, puzzled, \"Is this progress or regression? Why is a decentralized protocol becoming centralized again?\" The same confusion arises with Aave and MakerDAO—they are both transforming from open Lego blocks back into \"one-stop shops.\"\n\nOn the surface, this is a technical discussion about evolving DeFi protocols' business strategies; in reality, it reveals a fundamental tension that all platform economies must confront: the eternal struggle between innovation and efficiency.\n\nFirst, how does the evolution of DeFi protocols typically proceed?\n\nTraditionally, technological progress is expected to be linear—from simple to complex, from closed to open, and from centralized to decentralized. However, the reality of DeFi shows us that evolution is actually spiral.\n\nMost successful DeFi protocols began as a \"vertically integrated\" product. Uniswap began as a tightly designed automated market maker (AMM), integrating all functions into a single smart contract. Aave began as a simple lending pool, with borrowers and depositors interacting directly. MakerDAO focused on creating a collateralized debt position system to generate the stablecoin DAI. This phase is characterized by clearly defined product boundaries but relatively narrow functionality.\n\nNext came the \"modularization\" phase. After these protocols achieved initial success, their development teams realized the network effects that open functionality brings. Uniswap V2 allows the exchange of any ERC-20 tokens and becomes the liquidity layer of other DeFi protocols; Aave opens a lending interface so that other protocols can call its services; MakerDAO accepts a variety of collaterals and becomes the \"central bank\" of the DeFi ecosystem. The keyword at this stage is composability - each protocol is like a Lego brick and can be freely combined with other protocols.\n\nThe theory of \"value network transfer\" mentioned by Clayton Christianson in \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" is perfectly reflected here. When the underlying technology is mature enough, the focus of competition will shift from the product itself to the construction of the ecosystem. The \"DeFi Summer\" of 2020-2021 was a period of explosive growth for this modularization dividend—the total value locked (TVL) soared from $1 billion to over $100 billion.\n\nHowever, modularization also brought new problems: **fragmented user experience and diluted value capture. **When users need to jump between five or six different protocols to complete an investment strategy, friction costs rise sharply. At the same time, competition between protocols intensifies, squeezing profit margins to the extreme.\n\n**Second, what is the best reintegration strategy? **\n\nFaced with the challenges of modularization, smart protocols are engaging in \"strategic reintegration\"—not returning to a completely closed state, but rather regaining control of key value points while maintaining openness.\n\nUniswap's approach is a prime example. It launched the Uniswap Wallet not to exclude other wallets, but to control the first touchpoint for user interaction. It developed the Uniswap X aggregator not to monopolize the market, but to ensure 85% of trading volume remains within its own ecosystem. And it built the Unichain blockchain not to compete with Ethereum, but to reduce transaction costs by 95% and latency to 250 milliseconds. **The essence of this strategy lies in vertically integrating key links while maintaining openness and collaboration horizontally. **\n\nAave's reintegration is more nuanced. By launching the GHO stablecoin, it upgraded itself from a simple lending protocol to a \"DeFi central bank\" with currency issuance rights. It also entered the social finance space through the Lens Protocol, integrating financial services with social networks. Aave's TVL has exceeded $60 billion, covering 34 blockchains. This scale effect itself is the result of reintegration.\n\nMakerDAO (now the Sky ecosystem) has undergone the most radical transformation. Not only has it upgraded the MakerDAO brand to Sky, DAI to USDS, and MKR to SKY, it also plans to fork Solana to create NewChain. This may seem radical, but the strategic logic is clear: control the entire blockchain stack, from the underlying blockchain to the upper-layer applications. **\n\nMIT platform strategy expert Geoffrey Parker points out that successful platform reintegration has three key elements: **selective control** (controlling only the most critical value points), **ecosystem compatibility** (maintaining interoperability with external protocols), and **unified user experience** (providing seamless end-to-end services). The best reintegration is not \"big and comprehensive\" but \"precise and deep.\"\n\n**Third, why do many people misunderstand this reintegration? **\n\nThe most common misconception is that reintegration equates to \"betraying the ideal of decentralization.\" Many DeFi fundamentalists believe that any form of vertical integration is a compromise toward centralization. However, this view overlooks a key fact: **decentralization is not a goal in itself, but a means to achieve better financial services. **\n\nThe root of this misunderstanding lies in the confusion between \"open\" and \"decentralized.\" Uniswap's launch of its own wallet doesn't mean it's banning users from MetaMask; Aave's issuance of GHO doesn't mean it's no longer supporting other stablecoins. True openness isn't about \"doing nothing,\" but about \"doing your own thing without blocking others from doing theirs.\"\n\nThe second misconception is that reintegration slows innovation. Those who hold this view worry that when a protocol becomes \"big and comprehensive,\" it loses its drive for innovation, becoming bloated and conservative. The reality is quite the opposite. Uniswap V4 introduced a hooks mechanism, allowing developers to customize the logic for each liquidity pool, which is more innovative than any previous version. Sky's ecosystem's cross-chain feature, SkyLink, is also more advanced than the traditional MakerDAO. In his book \"The Power of Irrationality,\" behavioral economist Dan Ariely argues that people tend to become \"anchored\" on initial impressions and find it difficult to accept dynamic change. For many, Uniswap should always be a simple AMM, and Aave should always be focused on lending. But this static mindset ignores the reality of market competition: **If you don't evolve, you'll be eliminated.**\n\nThe most profound misunderstanding stems from a distorted understanding of the \"logic of competition.\" Traditional economics holds that competition leads to product homogeneity and diminishing profits. But in the platform economy, the logic of competition is different: **winner takes all, but the criterion for victory is the ecosystem's ability to create value, not the functionality of a single product. **When we understand this, we understand why Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO have all chosen the path of reintegration—they are not avoiding competition, but preparing for the next round.\n\n**Conclusion: The Wisdom of the Upward Spiral**\n\nGerman philosopher Hegel coined the concept of the upward spiral: historical progress is not linear, but rather achieved through the negation of negation. The evolution of DeFi protocols perfectly illustrates this philosophical perspective.\n\nFrom vertical integration to modularization, and then to strategic reintegration, this process may seem like a return to the starting point, but in reality, it is a reintegration at a higher level. While Uniswap today may look like a \"super app,\" its openness and composability far surpass its 2018 version. While the current Sky ecosystem controls more aspects, its transparency and governance mechanisms are also more sophisticated.\n\nPerhaps this is the true meaning of technological progress: not abandoning the past, but solving new problems while preserving its essence. Once we understand this, we will no longer be confused by the \"changes\" in DeFi protocols, but instead begin to look forward to their next evolution.\n\nAfter all, in a rapidly changing world, the greatest risk is not change itself, but the refusal to change itself.",
