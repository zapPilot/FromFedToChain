  "title": "From \"Misunderstanding\" to \"Rise\": Why Ethereum May Become the New Reserve Asset of the Digital Economy?",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered what it is that banks around the world are willing to hold as their \"treasury card\"? Historically, it was gold, then the US dollar, and now it might be something most people still don't understand: Ether (ETH).\n\nIt sounds absurd, right? How can a \"virtual currency\" be compared to \"real\" reserve assets like gold and the US dollar? But if I told you that financial institutions worth hundreds of billions of dollars are already using Ethereum as their \"operating system\" to build their infrastructure, you might start to reconsider.\n\nImagine this scenario: You are the CFO of a multinational bank and need to process an urgent cross-border transfer on the weekend. Traditionally, you'd have to wait until banks open on Monday, go through three to five intermediary banks, spend two to three days, and pay hundreds of dollars in fees. But using Ethereum, the transfer can be completed in minutes, at one-tenth the cost, and 24/7.\n\nOn the surface, this is a question of transaction efficiency. But in reality, it's about a fundamental shift in financial infrastructure.\n\n## First, how are reserve assets typically selected?\n\nHistory shows that reserve assets must meet several conditions: scarcity, divisibility, storability, and most importantlyâ€”network effects and institutional trust.\n\nGold reigned supreme for millennia because of its scarcity, incorruptibility, and universally recognized value. The US dollar became the world's reserve currency not only because of the US economic strength but also because of the institutional trust established by the Bretton Woods system.\n\nHowever, these traditional reserve assets share one characteristic: they are passive. Gold simply sits there, and US Treasury bonds simply wait to earn interest. Their value derives from scarcity and institutional promises, not from inherent functionality.\n\nEther breaks this paradigm. It isn't just \"stored\" but \"used.\" Every time someone issues a bond, conducts a transaction, or runs a smart contract on Ethereum, Ether is consumed. This creates an unprecedented form of \"functional scarcity\"â€”scarce not because it's difficult to mine, but because it has so many uses. Even more remarkable, after Ethereum completes its \"merge\" upgrade in 2022, it will achieve a phenomenon not even found in economics textbooks: as network usage increases, the supply of Ether will actually decrease. It's like a currency: the more prosperous the economy, the more scarce it automatically becomes.\n\n## Second, what's the best approach?\n\nSmart institutions are no longer treating Ether as a \"speculative asset,\" but rather as \"productive capital.\"\n\nBlackRock has launched the BUIDL fund on Ethereum, managing over $500 million in assets. JPMorgan Chase's JPM Coin processes over $1 billion in transactions daily on Ethereum-related networks. These companies aren't \"speculating\" on the cryptocurrency, but rather \"using it\"â€”using Ethereum as infrastructure to build their businesses.\n\nEven more importantly, the emergence of the \"staking\" mechanism. Traditionally, you hold US Treasury bonds to earn 2-3% annual interest. But staking Ether not only earns a 3-4% annual return but also provides security for the entire network. It's like your savings not only earning interest but also helping to maintain the security of the entire banking system.\n\nCurrently, approximately 28 million Ether (about 23% of the total supply) is staked, meaning nearly a quarter of all Ether is \"locked\" in the network's security. This capital won't just flow into the market and crash it, but rather serve a stabilizing function similar to that of a central bank.\n\nThe smartest approach is to recognize this shift: Ether is evolving from a \"speculative asset\" to an \"infrastructure asset.\" Institutions that understand and participate in this transformation early on will be well-positioned in the future digital financial system.\n\n## Third, why do most people misunderstand this?\n\nThe biggest misconception is viewing Ether as an \"improved Bitcoin\" or \"another hype tool.\" This is like viewing the internet as an \"improved telephone\" in 1995.\n\nPeople tend to interpret new things within old frameworks. When we hear \"digital currency,\" our first reaction is, \"It's a new form of money.\" But Ether is more like a hybrid of digital economy fuel and equity. It serves as a medium of exchange, a governance token, a source of income, and a security. This multifaceted nature does not exist in the traditional financial system.\n\nAnother cognitive trap is focusing too much on price volatility. Yes, Ether's price fluctuates wildly, but this is a normal phenomenon in emerging asset classes. The US dollar also experienced significant volatility in the 1970s, but this did not prevent it from becoming a global reserve currency. What matters is not short-term price stability, but long-term functional value.\n\nThe most fatal mistake is to ignore the exponential impact of technological progress. Most people think linearly, \"Ethereum can only process 15 transactions per second right now. How can it possibly support the global financial system?\" But they fail to consider that innovations like Layer 2 solutions and sharding are exponentially improving performance.\n\nJust as the internet evolved from dial-up in 1995 to today's 5G high-speed networks, Ethereum's processing power is also rapidly evolving. Those who only see current limitations and ignore the trend are like those who said in 1995, \"The internet is too slow to replace the telephone.\"\n\n## Philosophical Reflection: The Digitization of Trust\n\nWhether Ethereum can become a reserve asset ultimately depends on a deeper question: Are we willing to replace institutional commitments with mathematical proofs?\n\nThe foundation of trust in traditional reserve assets is institutionsâ€”we trust the government not to overprint currency and the central bank to responsibly manage interest rates. But institutions can make mistakes, become corrupt, and be influenced by politics. The 2008 financial crisis and recent inflationary issues remind us that trust in institutions is not infallible.\n\nEthereum offers a different model of trust: using cryptography and mathematics to ensure the execution of rules. You don't need to trust any person or institution, just the laws of mathematics. Of course, this also introduces new risksâ€”code vulnerabilities and technological failures.\n\nBut perhaps this is the inevitable direction of human social evolution. From \"trust in people\" to \"trust in institutions\" and then to \"trust in code,\" each step is a search for more reliable and fairer trust mechanisms.\n\nLet's return to the original question: Will Ethereum become the reserve asset of the digital economy? I don't know the definitive answer, but I do know that the question itself is profound. It forces us to rethink the nature of money, the sources of trust, and how technology can reshape the foundations of human collaboration.\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome, this experiment teaches us an important lesson: in a rapidly changing world, the greatest risk may not be embracing new things, but clinging to old ideas.",
