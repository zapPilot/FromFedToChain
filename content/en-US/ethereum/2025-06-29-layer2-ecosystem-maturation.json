      "content": "Friends, today let's talk about the massive changes in the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem over the past year. Looking back to when the Dencun upgrade just launched, everyone was still watching to see whether Layer 2 could truly solve Ethereum's scaling problems. Now it seems the answer is yes, but the process has been more interesting than we imagined.\n\nLet's look at the numbers first: Layer 2's daily transaction volume has exploded by 200% over the past year, reaching 6.5 million transactions. What does this mean? It's equivalent to processing 75 transactions per second, already approaching the processing capacity of traditional payment systems.\n\nMost surprising is Base's rise. This Layer 2 launched by Coinbase now handles 57% of Layer 2 transaction volume, surpassing veterans Arbitrum and Optimism. This tells us an important trend: platforms with real user bases have enormous advantages in the blockchain world too.\n\nThe fee reduction is even more stunning. Taking Base as an example, average transaction costs dropped from $0.5 before the upgrade to $0.0012 now, a decline of over 99%. This level of cost reduction makes many application scenarios that were uneconomical in traditional systems now viable.\n\nBut there's another side to the story. While transaction volume surged, it also brought new challenges: failed transaction rates rose dramatically. Base's transaction failure rate increased to 21%, mainly due to surging bot activity. This reminds us that technological progress often brings unexpected side effects.\n\nThe deeper change lies in the differentiation of application ecosystems. High-frequency trading, gaming, social media, and other fee-sensitive applications are migrating en masse to Layer 2. Meanwhile, large transfers requiring extremely high security still choose the Ethereum mainnet. This \"division of labor and cooperation\" model is becoming the new normal.\n\nFrom a technical architecture perspective, we're witnessing an interesting evolution: from \"one chain rules all\" to \"multi-chain collaboration for mutual benefit.\" Different Layer 2s optimize for different use cases, forming a more diversified ecosystem.\n\nThe significance of this change goes beyond just the technical level. It marks blockchain technology's shift from being \"technology-driven\" to \"demand-driven.\" Users no longer need to understand complex technical details; they only care about: is it fast, is it cheap, is it easy to use.\n\nLooking ahead, the Layer 2 ecosystem will continue to differentiate and specialize. We might see Layer 2s dedicated to serving gaming, Layer 2s specialized for DeFi, or even Layer 2s designed for specific applications. This specialization trend will further drive the maturation of the entire Ethereum ecosystem."
