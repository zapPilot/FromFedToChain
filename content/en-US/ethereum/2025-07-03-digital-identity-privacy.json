  "title": "The privacy paradox: Vitalik‚Äôs warning on the risks of zero-knowledge proof digital identity and the future of Web3",
  "content": "Have you ever thought that in the future, when you prove that \"you are you\" online, you may both protect your privacy and lose it at the same time? This seemingly contradictory problem is the core issue that Vitalik Buterin warned in his latest article at the end of June. Digital identity is one of the beautiful promises of Web3. Imagine that you can prove that you are a unique human being without revealing your real identity, so as to get a universal basic income airdrop. Zero-knowledge proof technology makes this possible: you can prove that you are \"over 18 years old\" without revealing your specific birthday, and prove that you \"have a college degree\" without saying which school. But Vitalik pointed out a deep risk: when this \"one person, one identity\" system becomes too popular, it may destroy the most precious thing in our digital world - pseudonymity. In the real world, you can have one identity at work, another identity on social media, and a third identity in interest communities. This \"multiple identities\" is not deception, but the core of privacy protection. You don't want your boss to see your weekend life, nor do you want strangers to know your work details. The problem is that when the digital identity system requires \"global uniqueness\", even if zero-knowledge proof is used technically, social pressure may force you to give up this multiplicity. Employers may require job seekers to disclose all social media accounts during interviews, and governments may require visa applicants to disclose activity records on specific platforms. Vitalik's solution is \"diversified identity\". It is not a universal digital identity, but different ways of proof in different situations. Some occasions use community trust (friends guarantee you), some occasions use institutional certification (school certificate), and some occasions use biometrics. It's like having multiple cards in your wallet: credit card, health insurance card, driver's license, each used in different occasions. This thinking has a deeper meaning. Technology itself is neutral, but the social system we build with technology will shape human behavior. Zero-knowledge proof is a powerful privacy tool, but if we use it to build a world where \"everyone must have and can only have one identity\", then privacy may disappear. This is the critical crossroads for the development of Web3. Are we going to build a freer and more private digital world, or will we accidentally create an environment that is more transparent and easier to monitor than Web2? Vitalik's warning reminds us that technological progress does not equal social progress. The real challenge is not how to make zero-knowledge proofs more efficient, but how to ensure that the systems we build with these technologies truly serve human freedom and dignity. The future of digital identity should not be a tool of control, but a framework for empowering individuals. This requires not only better cryptography, but also better social design.",
