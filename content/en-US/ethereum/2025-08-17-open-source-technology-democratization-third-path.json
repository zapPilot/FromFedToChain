  "title": "When Technology Becomes the New Class Divide: Why Does Vitalik Say Open Source Is the \"Third Way\" to Combat Technological Inequality?",
  "content": "The 18th-century French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau once wrote: \"Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains.\" If Rousseau were alive today, he might have said: \"All men are born equal, but everywhere they are in the shadow of algorithms.\" As we discuss technologies like AI, gene editing, and life extension that could redefine humanity's future, a troubling question arises: Will these technologies lead to greater equality, or will they create unprecedented class divisions?\n\nImagine this scenario: In 2030, your neighbor, Mr. Wang, spends 10 million yuan on genetic enhancements, extending his lifespan to 150 and boosting his IQ to 180. You can only watch helplessly as your own children, unenhanced, compete with these \"superhumans.\" This isn't science fiction; it's a reality we may soon face. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently published an article proposing a provocative perspective: open source technology may be the only way to prevent this \"technological caste system.\"\n\nOn the surface, this is a question about the choice of a model for technological development; in reality, it's a question about who will control the power distribution over humanity's future.\n\nFirst, how are these revolutionary technologies typically developed?\n\nThe current model can be summed up in one word: \"elite monopoly.\" Whether it's OpenAI's GPT series, Google's AlphaFold, or the gene therapies of major pharmaceutical companies, they all follow the same script: massive investment, patent protection, and high-priced sales.\n\nTake the gene-editing technology CRISPR, for example. While the underlying technology is relatively simple, true genetic therapy requires rigorous clinical trials and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The final cost of treatment often reaches hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, making it affordable only for the wealthiest. This is like building a \"biological Bastille,\" dividing humanity into \"genetic aristocrats\" and \"genetic commoners.\"\n\nThe situation in AI is equally troubling. Training a state-of-the-art large-scale language model requires millions of dollars in computing resources, a feat only accessible to tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. These companies control not only the direction of technological development but also who has access to it. The fundamental problem with this model is that it creates \"double inequality\": the wealthy not only gain access to new technologies earlier and more cheaply, but also participate in their development and profit distribution, while ordinary people can only passively accept them.\n\nIn Capital in the Twenty-First Century, economist Thomas Piketty argues that when the rate of return on capital consistently exceeds the rate of economic growth, wealth inequality will continue to widen. In an era of technological revolution, this logic is magnified: when the rate of return on technological innovation far exceeds that of general economic activity, the gap between those who control technology and those who do not will widen exponentially.\n\n**Second, what exactly is the \"better approach\" to the open source model? **\n\nThe open source model proposed by Vitalik is essentially a form of \"technological communism\"‚Äînot the shared ownership of property, but the shared ownership of knowledge. This model has four core advantages, each of which directly addresses the pain points of the existing system.\n\nFirst, \"equal access.\" When a technology is open source, it is automatically open to all countries and all people. Programmers in India can develop world-class software based on Linux, and farmers in Kenya can use open source agricultural AI to increase their yields. Marginal costs are often low, and the real barrier is the knowledge barrier, which open source dismantles.\n\nSecond, \"producer equality.\" This is a deeper level of equality than simple access rights. Open source enables anyone, anywhere in the world, to become a creator of technology, not just a consumer. Think about how Android enabled hundreds of companies to produce smartphones, rather than just Apple dominating.\n\nThird is verifiability. Open source means transparency; anyone can inspect the code, algorithms, and even the decision-making process. This is especially crucial in the age of AI‚Äîwhen algorithms determine your credit limit, job opportunities, and even the length of your prison sentence, you have the right to know how these decisions were made.\n\nFinally, there's the elimination of vendor lock-in. Providers of proprietary technology can change terms, raise prices, or even discontinue service at any time. But if the technology is open source, users always have the right to fix it themselves or find alternatives. This is a guarantee of technological sovereignty.\n\nNobel laureate in economics Elinor Ostrom, while studying \"public resource management,\" discovered that, under appropriate governance mechanisms, shared resources not only do not lead to the \"tragedy of the commons,\" but can actually create greater efficiency than private or state ownership. The Linux operating system, Wikipedia, and even the Bitcoin network are all examples of the success of this model.\n\n**Third, why do most people misunderstand the open source model?**\n\nResistance to the open source model often stems from three cognitive biases: security fear, zero-sum thinking, and a belief in \"gatekeepers.\"\n\nFirst, security fear. Many worry that open source will be used for malicious purposes. If gene editing technology is fully open source, will someone develop biological weapons? If AI models are open source, will they be used to generate disinformation? While this concern may seem reasonable, it overlooks a crucial question: Are closed systems truly more secure? The Soviet Union's biological weapons program, state-sponsored access to technology, and the algorithmic biases of large tech companies all demonstrate the unreliability of \"gatekeepers.\"\n\nSecondly, there's zero-sum thinking. People often assume that if a technology becomes widespread, the advantages of early adopters will disappear. But this thinking ignores the power of network effects. When more people use a technology, the entire ecosystem becomes stronger and more valuable. Consider the internet‚Äîits open nature has created unprecedented opportunities for innovation and economic opportunity.\n\nThe most profound misconception is the belief in \"professional gatekeepers.\" Conventional wisdom holds that complex technologies require professional management and control to ensure security and quality. But who oversees these overseers? Facebook's election manipulation, Google's search bias, and government surveillance programs around the world all demonstrate the dangers of centralized power. As Lord Acton famously said, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n\nMore subtly, people often understand \"owning things\" more easily than \"owning rights.\" Buying a car is concrete, but having the \"right to repair it\" is abstract. However, in an increasingly digital world, \"owning rights\" may be even more important than \"owning things.\"\n\n**Philosophical Reflection: The True Meaning of Technological Democratization**\n\nWhen we discuss open source vs. proprietary technology, we're actually discussing a more fundamental question: How should power be distributed in a world reshaped by technology?\n\nVitalik's \"Third Way\" reminds us that we don't have to choose between \"innovation speed\" and \"social equity.\" Open source isn't a utopia; it has its own problems and limitations. But it offers a possibility: to share the benefits of technology more broadly and allow more people to participate in the creation of the future.\n\nPerhaps the real question isn't whether a technology should be open source, but whether we have the courage to reimagine a more equitable technological future. As American computer scientist Alan Kay said, \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it.\" And creating a better future may require not smarter gatekeepers, but more open gates.\n\nIn this debate about humanity's future, none of us is a bystander. Every application we use, every platform we support, every technological choice we make, is a vote on this issue. Choosing open source is not just a choice of a technological model; it is a choice of values: a belief that knowledge should be the common wealth of mankind, that innovation should be a collective endeavor, and that the future should be written by all of us.",
