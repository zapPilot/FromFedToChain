  "title": "Ethereum Core Evolution: How Pectra Upgrade Redefines Account Experience and 100,000 TPS Vision",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why you need to sign and confirm each operation separately when using Ethereum applications, and you also need to prepare ETH to pay the fees? These seemingly reasonable \"troubles\" are being completely rewritten by the Pectra upgrade in May this year. Imagine that your wallet can operate like a smart contract: authorize multiple transactions at one time, let friends pay for the fees, and even restore it safely when you lose your private key. This is not a science fiction novel, but the \"account abstraction\" revolution brought by EIP-7702. A traditional Ethereum account is like a credit card that can only be swiped, with a single function but security. EIP-7702 allows your account to be temporarily \"upgraded\" to a smart contract, gaining functions such as batch transactions and entrusted payments, and returning to its original security state after use. It's like installing a removable smart chip on a credit card. At the same time, EIP-7251 increases the validator's effective balance limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This is not just a numerical change, but a fundamental improvement in network efficiency. The stake that originally required 1,000 validator nodes can now be completed with only 16, greatly reducing the burden on the network. But Pectra is just the starting point. The real change lies in the \"100,000 TPS vision\" that Ethereum is building. This goal is not a simple technical show-off, but an ambition to make blockchain truly serve the global economy. This vision has three key components: First is the upcoming Verkle tree technology, which is planned to be implemented in the Fusaka upgrade at the end of the year. It can greatly reduce the blockchain state data, allowing nodes to synchronize faster and store less. Next is \"Single-Slot Finality\", which aims to shorten the transaction confirmation time from the current 15 minutes to 12 seconds. Finally, Layer 2 is widely popularized to form a professional application ecosystem. The combination of these three is like building a modern transportation system: Verkle tree is an efficient data highway, single-slot finality is an instant traffic signal, and Layer 2 is a variety of dedicated lanes. Together, they support a processing capacity of 100,000 TPS. What does this mean for ordinary users? You will experience a smoothness close to Web2: complete complex operations with one click, without worrying about fees or waiting for long confirmations. For developers, this is the infrastructure for building truly large-scale applications. Ethereum's evolution strategy is smart: not a one-time major change, but a gradual systemic upgrade. Each step enhances capabilities on the existing basis while maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. This evolution is redefining the boundaries of blockchain possibilities. Ethereum is no longer just a smart contract platform, but is becoming the infrastructure that supports the global digital economy.",
