  "title": "ERC-3643: When \"ID Card\" Meets Blockchain — Why the Breakthrough in Real-World Asset Tokenization Isn't Technology, But Philosophy?",
  "content": "The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said, \"You cannot step into the same river twice.\" But in the world of fintech, we face a more paradoxical phenomenon: how can a brand-new \"digital river\" (blockchain) meet the \"ancient river\" of traditional finance without causing one to conflict or dry up? ERC-3643, a seemingly technical token standard, actually represents a significant turning point in the history of blockchain development—a shift from radical \"disruption\" thinking to pragmatic \"integration\" wisdom.\n\nImagine this scenario: You're transferring ownership of a property at the Taipei City Government, and the staff member tells you, \"Starting tomorrow, we're switching to a completely new digital system. All your old IDs, seals, and household registrations will no longer be recognized. You must apply for a new digital identity.\" You might find this absurd—why can't they retain existing identity verification systems and gradually integrate digital tools? However, this is precisely the \"revolution\" that blockchain has been attempting to drive for the past decade: requiring traditional financial institutions to abandon all existing compliance frameworks and embrace a fully decentralized world. The emergence of ERC-3643 is like a brilliant engineer saying, \"We can build a bridge that allows two worlds to coexist peacefully.\"\n\nOn the surface, ERC-3643 is a token technology standard that solves compliance issues; in reality, it represents a significant shift in the blockchain industry from ideological purism to practical pragmatism.\n\n## First, how is traditional blockchain tokenization typically done?\n\nBefore discussing ERC-3643, let's first understand the logic of traditional methods. The most widely known ERC-20 standard is like \"digital cash\"—anyone can hold and transfer it, without identity restrictions or compliance checks. This design philosophy stems from Bitcoin's decentralization philosophy: finance should be permissionless, and anyone should be able to participate freely.\n\nThis logic works well in the world of purely digital assets. When you send Ethereum or Bitcoin to a friend, no bank asks if you're an \"accredited investor,\" and no government demands proof of source. Just like a cash transaction, it's anonymous, instant, and irrevocable.\n\nBut problems arise when blockchains attempt to carry real-world assets (RWAs)—such as real estate, company stocks, bonds, and commodities. Transactions in these assets are strictly regulated in the real world. You can't simply transfer ownership of a building to a stranger, you can't anonymously purchase shares in a public company, and you can't trade commodities without conducting anti-money laundering checks.\n\nTraditional blockchain solutions are often \"engineered\": adding a layer of compliance checks to the token contract. It's like putting a security gate outside an open library—it works in theory, but in practice it's prone to vulnerabilities and inconveniences. More importantly, this kind of external compliance checks often can't cope with complex cross-border regulatory requirements. Your token might be legal in Singapore, but illegal in the EU, and might require additional disclosure in the US.\n\nAs a result, truly valuable RWAs are difficult to circulate on the blockchain, institutional investors are deterred, and regulators remain conservative. By 2023, the entire \"tokenization\" market is expected to be worth less than $10 billion, a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of trillions of dollars in global financial assets.\n\n## Second, why is ERC-3643's approach smarter?\n\nERC-3643 adopts a fundamentally different design philosophy. Rather than adding compliance checks as an afterthought, it \"baks\" identity verification and compliance logic into the very fabric of the token. Just as modern architecture considers earthquake resistance, fire resistance, and barrier-free accessibility from the design stage, ERC-3643 considers regulatory compliance from the protocol level.\n\nThe core mechanism is the \"ONCHAINID\" system: each participant must possess an on-chain identity, which includes verified \"claims.\" For example, Alice's ONCHAINID might include claims such as \"Qualified Investor Certified by the US SEC,\" \"Not on the OFAC Sanctions List,\" and \"Resident in New York.\" When Alice wants to purchase an ERC-3643 token representing commercial real estate, the smart contract automatically checks: Does the transaction comply with pre-defined rules? Do the identities of both the sender and receiver meet the requirements?\n\nEven more ingenious is the modular design. Different assets can have different compliance rules. A fund investing in US real estate might require investors to be \"accredited investors\" and not from sanctioned countries; whereas a carbon credit token might only require verification that the purchaser is a registered business. These rules can be flexibly configured through the \"ComplianceService\" contract without modifying the core token logic.\n\nMarket data suggests this approach is proving successful. The ERC-3643 protocol currently supports over $32 billion in tokenized assets and has the support of 78 industry leaders, including traditional financial giants like Citi and JPMorgan Chase. The Kadena report predicts that $25 billion in RWAs will be tokenized using the ERC-3643 standard by 2025.\n\nThis success is no accident. ERC-3643 solves a key \"institutional arbitrage\" problem: it allows traditional financial institutions to leverage the efficiency advantages of blockchain (24/7 trading, instant settlement, and programmability) while remaining within existing regulatory frameworks. It's like providing traditional banks with a \"compliant blockchain\"—innovative yet legal.\n\n## Third, why do most people misunderstand this shift?\n\nMisunderstandings about ERC-3643 stem primarily from three cognitive biases: ideological purism, technological determinism, and a misunderstanding of the definition of \"success.\"\n\nThe most obvious is ideological purism. Many blockchain fundamentalists believe that any system requiring identity verification betrays Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision. They argue, \"If KYC is required, why not just use traditional banks?\" This perspective overlooks a crucial fact: different use cases require different solutions. While sending small amounts of cryptocurrency to friends might not require identity verification, managing a multi-million dollar real estate fund doesn't allow for such capriciousness.\n\nIn his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman argues that people often approach complex problems with an \"all-or-nothing\" mindset. In the blockchain space, this mindset manifests as: either it's completely decentralized or it's not a true blockchain. But reality often lies somewhere in between. ERC-3643 offers \"selective centralization\"—maintaining compliance in identity verification while maintaining decentralization in transaction execution.\n\nSecondly, there's the misconception of \"technological determinism.\" Many people assume that technological progress is linear, that new technologies should completely replace old ones. However, history shows that the most successful technological innovations often involve \"incremental integration\" rather than \"disruptive replacement.\" The internet hasn't replaced all traditional media; rather, it coexists with them and creates new hybrid forms. Smartphones haven't forced everyone to stop using computers; instead, they leverage their respective strengths in different scenarios.\n\nERC-3643 embodies this wisdom: it doesn't attempt to replace the traditional financial system, but rather provides a \"digital upgrade\" for traditional assets. It allows a Manhattan office building to enjoy the advantages of blockchain (global liquidity, 24/7 trading, programmable management) while maintaining the regulatory compliance of traditional real estate investment.\n\nThe most profound misunderstanding is a confusion about the definition of \"success.\" The success of a blockchain shouldn't be measured solely by its degree of decentralization, but rather by whether it creates real value. The TCP/IP protocol isn't the most advanced network protocol, but it has become the cornerstone of the internet because it strikes a balance between technological superiority and practicality. Similarly, ERC-3643 may not be the most \"pure\" blockchain application, but it is unlocking liquidity for trillions of dollars in assets, which is true value creation.\n\n## Philosophical Reflection: Technology Serves People, Not the Other Way Around\n\nReturning to Heraclitus's river metaphor, perhaps we need to rethink what true \"change\" means. The significance of ERC-3643 lies not in its advanced technical features, but in the mature way of thinking it represents: technology should serve human needs, not force people to adapt to its limitations.\n\nIn an ideal world, perhaps we wouldn't need the \"constraints\" of identity verification and regulatory compliance. But in the real world, these systems are essential tools to protect investors, maintain market order, and mitigate systemic risks. A truly useful technology shouldn't demand that the real world conform to its ideals; rather, it should adapt to the complexity of the real world while maintaining its own strengths.\n\nThe story of ERC-3643 teaches us that the most profound revolutions are often not the most radical, but the most practical. When we stop arguing about the purity of technology and begin to focus on its practicality, true innovation begins. In this sense, ERC-3643 is not just a token standard, it is a symbol of the maturity of the blockchain industry.",
