  "title": "The new business battlefield of zero-knowledge proof: When cryptographic operations become tradable digital commodities",
  "content": "Have you ever imagined that mathematical computation itself could one day become a commodity like electricity or internet bandwidth, freely traded on the market? It sounds abstract, but in the world of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), this future has already arrived. With Succinct launching a decentralized ZK proof generation market, RISC Zero's Bonsai platform achieving a 10x cost reduction, and Cysic raising $12 million to develop dedicated ZK chips, we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new industry: the zero-knowledge computing market.\n\n## The Transition from Cryptography Labs to the Commercial Arena\n\nRemember the early days of the internet? Initially a research tool for academic institutions and the military, who could have imagined it would evolve into the infrastructure that underpins the global economy today? Zero-knowledge proofs are undergoing a similar transformation.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs began as purely academic research, addressing the theoretical problem of \"how to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.\" However, with the advancement of blockchain technology, ZK proofs have moved from the laboratory into the real world, rapidly evolving into a variety of business models.\n\nToday, ZK proofs are no longer just a technical concept; they are a real business need. Whenever you use a Layer 2 network like Polygon's zkEVM, whenever a cross-chain bridge needs to verify transaction validity, or whenever a DeFi protocol needs to protect user privacy, a large number of ZK proofs must be generated. Generating these proofs requires enormous computational resources, creating a whole new market opportunity.\n\n## Technical Architecture Determines Business Fate: Different ZK Systems, Different Ways to Make Money\n\nBefore delving into business models, we need to understand a key fact: different ZK technical architectures lead to vastly different business opportunities.\n\n**zk-SNARKs: Speed is Money**\n\nzk-SNARKs are like the \"supercars\" of the ZK world. It requires a complex \"trust ceremony\" to get started (much like a racing car requires professional tuning), but once it's in place, verification is extremely fast, and proof files are small.\n\nThis characteristic makes zk-SNARKs particularly well-suited for high-frequency trading scenarios. Imagine a decentralized exchange processing thousands of transactions per second. It requires extremely fast verification speeds and is less concerned with initial setup costs. This creates a \"high-frequency, low-latency\" business model for companies specializing in zk-SNARKs services—fees may be high, but customers are willing to pay for the speed.\n\n**zk-STARKs: The Premium of Transparency**\n\nzk-STARKs are like \"off-road vehicles\"—they don't require a trust ceremony and can handle more complex computations, but they are also bulky. This technology is particularly popular among projects prioritizing security and decentralization.\n\nStarkNet is one of the most successful commercial applications of zk-STARKs. Its business model is based on a \"transparency premium\"—customers are willing to pay a higher fee for mathematical guarantees that don't require trust in any third party. This model is particularly well-suited for high-value, security-sensitive transactions.\n\n**Bulletproofs: The Value of Privacy**\n\nBulletproofs are slower to verify, but they offer unique advantages in privacy protection. This has created a specialized market for \"privacy services,\" where customers are willing to incur the additional cost and time required to protect business secrets or personal privacy.\n\n## Five Game-Changing ZK Business Models\n\nBased on my in-depth market research, I've identified five major business models emerging in the ZK space, each with its own unique value proposition and competitive dynamics.\n\n### 1. Proof-as-a-Service: The Evolution of Cloud Computing\n\nRISC Zero's Bonsai platform is a prime example of this model. They've built a service similar to AWS Lambda, but specifically for ZK proof generation.\n\n**Business Logic**: Developers don't need to purchase expensive GPUs or learn complex ZK programming; they simply make API calls to obtain the required proofs. Bonsai's pricing model is based on the number of concurrent proofs and a budget for compute cycles, with customers paying based on actual usage.\n\n**Key to Success**: Bonsai claims to have achieved a 10x cost reduction, a revolutionary improvement in the ZK space. Their competitive advantage lies not only in technical optimization but also in economies of scale—as more customers use their services, infrastructure costs are amortized, enabling them to offer lower prices.\n\n**Market Potential**: This model is rapidly expanding because it addresses the biggest barriers to adoption of ZK technology: complexity and cost. We expect to see the emergence of more specialized ZK PaaS services, providing optimized solutions for different scenarios (such as privacy protection, cross-chain verification, and AI-powered computational verification).\n\n### 2. Hardware-as-a-Service: A New Form of Computing Power Rental\n\nWith the explosive growth in demand for ZK computing, the market for specialized hardware is rapidly developing. Companies like Cysic and Ingonyama are developing ASICs and FPGA accelerators specifically for ZK proof generation.\n\n**Dual Business Model**: These companies are adopting a dual strategy. On the one hand, they sell hardware directly to large operators and Layer 2 projects; on the other hand, they also provide \"Hardware-as-a-Service,\" allowing customers to access their specialized hardware via APIs.\n\n**Techno-economics**: The advantage of FPGAs is that they can be reprogrammed in under a second, meaning that the same piece of hardware can serve multiple different ZK systems. While more efficient, ASICs are extremely expensive to develop (US$8 million for a 28nm process and US$25 million for a 5nm process), making them economically viable only when the market is large enough.\n\nMarket Forecast: Analysts predict that the ZK proof generation market will exceed US$1 billion within 3-5 years, making dedicated hardware investments attractive. Early hardware providers may enjoy higher profit margins, but as the market matures, competition will drive costs down.\n\n### 3. Protocol Token Economics: Succinct's Innovative Experiment\n\nSuccinct's $PROVE token model represents a significant innovation in the ZK space: it makes proof generation a decentralized market.\n\n**Three-Layer Token Functionality**:\n- **Payment Layer**: All proof generation fees must be paid with $PROVE\n- **Security Layer**: Validators must stake $PROVE, and malicious behavior can be penalized\n- **Governance Layer**: Token holders vote on protocol parameters\n\n**Market Mechanism Design**: Succinct employs a \"reverse auction\" model, where proof providers compete to submit the lowest bid. This design theoretically ensures the best price for customers while incentivizing providers to be efficient.\n\n**Long-Term Value Capture**: As network usage increases, demand for $PROVE will also increase, potentially driving up the token price. At the same time, the staking mechanism locks up a portion of the token supply, further influencing market dynamics.\n\n### 4. Aggregation Layer Strategy: Polygon's Strategic Transformation\n\nPolygon's recent strategic shift—from focusing solely on the zkEVM to building the AggLayer aggregation layer—reveals a key trend in the ZK space: a shift from \"single player\" to \"ecosystem coordinator.\"\n\n**Business Insight**: Polygon recognizes that the future will not see a single \"winner takes all\" ZK chain, but rather multiple specialized ZK chains coexisting. The real value may lie in connecting these chains to provide a unified user experience and liquidity.\n\n**Revenue Model**: AggLayer can generate revenue in multiple ways:\n- Cross-chain transaction fees\n- Shared security service fees\n- MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) revenue sharing\n- Providing infrastructure services to connected ZK chains\n\n**Network Effect**: As more ZK chains connect to AggLayer, the value of the entire network will grow exponentially. This \"platform\" business model has enormous potential returns, but also presents significant challenges to implementation.\n\n### 5. Vertical Integration Strategy: Full-Stack Services from Chips to Applications\n\nSome forward-thinking companies are beginning to explore vertical integration strategies, aiming to control the entire value chain, from hardware to applications.\n\n**Integration Advantages**:\n\n**Cost Control**: Developing in-house hardware significantly reduces proof generation costs.\n\n**Performance Optimization**: Deep hardware and software integration enables superior performance.\n\n**Competitive Differentiation**: Providing unique value that is difficult for competitors to replicate.\n\n**Challenges and Risks**: Vertical integration requires significant capital investment and multi-domain expertise. Furthermore, the advantages of vertical integration may diminish if market standardization increases.\n\n## ZK Value Chain Analysis: Where is the Money?\n\nTo understand the business opportunity in the ZK market, we need to analyze the entire value chain. I divide it into five layers, each with different profit models and competitive dynamics.\n\n**Layer 0: Basic Cryptography Research**\nThis is the foundation of the entire ecosystem and is primarily driven by academic institutions and research labs. While this layer has limited direct commercial value, it provides the theoretical foundation for all commercial activities in the layers above it. Some companies profit from this layer through patents or technology licensing.\n\n**Layer 1: ZK Proof Systems and Development Tools**\nProjects such as StarkWare's Cairo language and RISC Zero's zkVM fall into this layer. While many are open source, companies can monetize these tools by offering enterprise versions, technical support, or building services based on them.\n\n**Layer 2: Dedicated Hardware Acceleration**\nThis is currently the most attractive layer for investment. With the explosive growth in demand for ZK, the demand for specialized hardware is also rapidly increasing. Successful hardware companies can not only sell products but also provide computing power as a service.\n\n**Layer 3: Proof Generation Services**\nRISC Zero Bonsai, Succinct, and others compete in this layer. The business model at this layer is relatively mature, and the main competitive factors are price, performance, and ease of use.\n\n**Layer 4: ZK Applications and Protocols**\nThis layer includes various ZK rollups, privacy-preserving applications, cross-chain bridges, and more. This layer monetizes through transaction fees, token economics, or enterprise services.\n\n**Profitability Analysis**:\n- **Highest Profit Margin**: Dedicated Hardware (Layer 2), Especially in the Early Stages of the Market\n- **Largest Market Size**: Application Layer (Layer 4), Because It Directly Faces End Users\n- **Most Stable Revenue**: Proof Generation Services (Layer 3), Similar to a Cloud Computing Business Model\n- **Highest Risk, Highest Return**: Aggregation and Protocol Layers, Requiring Strong Network Effects\n\n## Three Phases of Market Evolution: Where Are We Now?\n\nBased on an analysis of current market conditions and technological development trends, I believe the ZK computing market will progress through three distinct phases of development.\n\n**Phase 1: The Specialization Dividend Period (2024-2026, Current Phase)**\n\nWe are currently in this phase. Characteristics include:\n- **High Technical Barrier**: Only a small number of professional teams can provide high-quality ZK services\n- **High Profit Margin**: Due to the scarcity of supply, service providers can charge higher fees\n- **Capital Intensity**: Requires significant investment in specialized hardware and recruiting top talent\n- **Customer Focus**: Primary customers are Layer 2 projects, cross-chain bridges, and other infrastructure projects\n\nThe typical company strategy in this phase is to build a technological moat, capture market share, and prepare for the next phase of competition.\n\n**Phase Two: Standardization and Competition (2026-2028)**\n\nAs technology matures and tools improve, this market will enter the standardization phase:\n\n- **Lowering of technical barriers**: More companies will be able to enter the market, and development tools will become more user-friendly.\n- **Intensified price competition**: As supply increases, profit margins will come under pressure.\n- **Service differentiation**: Companies will begin to focus on specific verticals or provide value-added services.\n- **Consolidation begins**: Some small companies may be acquired by larger companies or exit the market.\n\nThe key to success in this phase is establishing scale advantages, cultivating customer loyalty, or finding a niche market.\n\n**Phase 3: Ecosystem Harmonization (after 2028)**\n\nThe market will enter a mature phase, with a new competitive landscape emerging:\n- **Platform Competition**: Similar to today's cloud computing market, a few large platforms will dominate the market.\n- **Ecosystem Integration**: Interoperability between different ZK systems will become increasingly important.\n- **Return to Specialization**: Building on large platforms, specialized services targeting specific industries or applications will emerge.\n- **Regulatory Intervention**: As the market scale expands, regulators may enact relevant rules.\n\n## Real Barriers to Adoption: The Gap Between Ideals and Reality\n\nWhile ZK technology holds a bright future, it still faces several key challenges in achieving large-scale commercialization.\n\n**Cost-Performance Balance**\n\nAlthough RISC Zero claims to achieve a 10x cost reduction, ZK proof generation remains expensive. A complex ZK proof can take minutes to compute and cost hundreds of dollars. This limits the use of ZK technology for small transactions or real-time applications.\n\n**Developer Experience Gap**\n\nWriting ZK circuits requires in-depth cryptographic knowledge, which is a significant barrier for most developers. While some companies are developing more user-friendly tools, ZK is still a long way from being easily accessible to ordinary developers.\n\n**Lack of Standardization**\n\nDifferent ZK systems use different proof formats and verification methods, resulting in a fragmented ecosystem. Developers need to rewrite code for different platforms, increasing development and maintenance costs.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty\n\nEspecially for privacy-focused ZK applications, regulators may restrict their use due to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. This uncertainty can impact enterprise adoption decisions.\n\nTrust and Security Issues\n\nWhile ZK proofs offer mathematically robust security guarantees, actual implementations may contain bugs or vulnerabilities. Any security issues could severely impact the credibility of the entire industry.\n\n## Investment Opportunities and Strategic Recommendations\n\nBased on the above analysis, I believe the following investment and development opportunities exist in the ZK computing market:\n\n**Short-Term Opportunities (1-2 Years)**\n\n1. **Hardware Acceleration Companies**: Companies such as Cysic and Ingonyama, particularly those focused on FPGA solutions\n\n2. **Developer Tools**: Tools and platforms that significantly lower the barrier to entry for ZK development\n\n3. **Proof-as-a-Service**: A business model similar to RISC Zero Bonsai, but focused on specific verticals\n\n**Medium-Term Opportunities (3-5 Years)**\n\n1. **Aggregation Layer Protocols**: Infrastructure projects that connect multiple ZK chains\n\n2. **Enterprise ZK Solutions**: Professional ZK services tailored to enterprise needs such as supply chain and identity authentication\n\n3. **ZK Security Services**: Dedicated ZK circuit auditing and security testing services\n\n**Long-term Opportunities (5+ years)**\n\n1. **ZK-native Applications**: New applications and business models built entirely on ZK technology\n2. **Cross-Industry Integration**: Deep integration of ZK technology with traditional industries such as AI, IoT, and supply chain\n3. **Regulatory Compliance Tools**: Compliance solutions that help ZK applications meet the requirements of different jurisdictions\n\n## Conclusion: The Commercial Value of Mathematical Proofs\n\nZero-knowledge proofs represent a fundamental shift: from \"trusting people\" to \"trusting mathematics,\" from \"centralized verification\" to \"cryptographic assurance.\" This shift is not only a technological innovation, but also a revolution in business models.\n\nWe are witnessing the commoditization of computing itself. Just as electricity evolved from a novelty in the late 19th century to infrastructure in the 20th century, ZK computing is moving from academic labs to commercial applications, from a niche technology to the foundation of the digital economy.\n\nWhen Succinct established the $PROVE token economy, they were effectively creating a \"futures market for mathematical proofs.\" When RISC Zero offered Bonsai services, they were selling \"verifiable computing cloud services.\" When Polygon shifted to the AggLayer strategy, they were building the \"Internet of ZK Chains.\"\n\nWhat's unique about this market is that it's not just the commoditization of technology services, but the commoditization of trust itself. In traditional businesses, trust often needs to be established through brands, laws, or intermediaries. But in the ZK world, trust is established through mathematical proofs, creating entirely new business possibilities.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe the ZK computing market will develop into a multi-layered, diverse ecosystem. Within this ecosystem, some companies will focus on hardware innovation, some on algorithm optimization, some on developer tools, and still others on end-use applications.\n\nRegardless of the business model, the key to success lies in understanding one fundamental fact: ZK technology is not simply a tool for solving technical problems; it is the infrastructure that redefines trust, privacy, and value exchange. Atop this infrastructure, new business models and new economic forms will emerge that are difficult to imagine today.\n\nZero-knowledge proof teaches us a profound lesson: in the digital age, what's most valuable may not be what you know, but what you can prove and how you prove it. When this \"proof\" itself becomes a tradable digital commodity, we've truly entered a whole new economic era.",
