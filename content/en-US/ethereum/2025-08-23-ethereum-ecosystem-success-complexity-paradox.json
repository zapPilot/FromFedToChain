  "title": "When Success Becomes a Burden: Why Ethereum’s 2025 Technical Victory Creates More Complex Ecosystem Risks",
  "content": "The story of the ancient Greek philosopher Icarus teaches us that wings that soar too high will be melted by the sun. In the blockchain world, Ethereum faces a similar paradox: its technological success is creating unprecedented ecosystem complexity. In 2025, when we reflect on the groundbreaking improvements brought about by the Dencun and Pectra upgrades, we will observe a thought-provoking phenomenon: every technical problem solved has created three new management challenges.\n\nImagine your friend Xiao Wang, the owner of a small tech company in Taipei. Initially, his company had only five employees, and all decisions were made in a single office, resulting in highly efficient communication but limited business volume. As the business grew in success, the company expanded to 50, then 500, and eventually became a multinational corporation. On the surface, this was a tremendous success—revenue increased 100-fold, and service capabilities increased a thousand-fold. However, Xiao Wang discovered that he now spent more time coordinating departments, managing different offices, and dealing with cross-border regulations than he did on actual business operations. Success hadn't led to simplification, but rather an explosion of complexity. This is the core dilemma facing Ethereum in 2025.\n\nOn the surface, this is a progress story about how technological upgrades improve network performance; in reality, it's a philosophical reflection on how success shifted from \"solving problems\" to \"managing problems.\"\n\nFirst, how did Ethereum originally work?\n\nTo understand today's complexity, we need to return to the original design philosophy. Ethereum was originally conceived as a \"world computer\"—a massive, slow, yet extremely secure, decentralized computer that everyone could use and trust.\n\nThis design resembles an old-fashioned workshop: all work, from design to manufacturing to quality control, is performed by the same team of craftsmen in a single location. The advantages of this model are reliable quality, transparent processes, and perfect control over every step. However, the drawback is also obvious: production capacity is extremely limited. When demand increases, the entire system becomes \"traffic jammed.\"\n\nUnder this model, every transaction needs to be verified and executed by every node in the network. This is like requiring every bank transaction to be personally signed by the presidents of all banks—highly secure but extremely inefficient. During the DeFi summer of 2020-2021, Ethereum transaction fees soared to over $100 per transaction, completely excluding ordinary users from the system.\n\nIn his book, Economic Thinking, American economist Thomas Sowell noted that any system design faces the constraints of the \"impossible triangle.\" In Ethereum's original design, the three vertices of this triangle were security, decentralization, and scalability. The choice at the time was to sacrifice scalability to ensure the first two. This was a wise decision in the early stages of technological development, but as the ecosystem matured, this trade-off became increasingly unsustainable.\n\n**Second, why is the Ethereum ecosystem's approach in 2025 superior?**\n\nEthereum in 2025 has completely changed this paradigm. With the introduction of Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) in the Dencun upgrade and the increase in validator balances in the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum has evolved from a \"world computer\" to a \"world court\"—no longer processing every small transaction, but instead focusing on providing final security and dispute resolution.\n\nThis transformation is similar to the establishment of the federal reserve banking system. The Federal Reserve doesn't process your daily credit card transactions for coffee, but it provides final clearing and security for the entire banking system. Individual retail banks (similar to Layer 2) process daily small transactions and then submit net settlements to the Federal Reserve at the end of the day. This layered architecture ensures both efficiency and system stability.\n\nThe core innovation of the Dencun upgrade is the introduction of the \"blob space\" concept. Blobs are temporary 128KB blocks of data used exclusively for publishing transaction data on the Layer 2 network. This design is ingenious: Layer 2 networks can submit batches of transaction data to the Ethereum mainnet at a significantly lower cost (10-100 times lower), and this data only needs to be stored for approximately 18 days—enough for dispute resolution without permanently occupying blockchain space.\n\nThe results are astonishing. Base Layer 2 transaction volume increased by 224% after the upgrade, and transaction fees dropped from $0.31 to nearly $0. The total value locked (TVL) of Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism increased by over 300% between 2024 and 2025, reaching over $60 billion.\n\nThe Pectra upgrade further addresses the issue of staking centralization. By increasing the maximum validator balance from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, a single validator can handle more staking, reducing the total number of validators in the network and improving consensus efficiency. Furthermore, lower entry barriers (reduced penalty mechanisms and faster startup times) enable more independent stakers to participate in network security.\n\nThe true breakthrough of this model lies in its composability. Although computation is decentralized across different Layer 2 layers, collaboration between these layers is enabled by standardized bridge protocols and a shared security model. This is similar to how banks in different countries can seamlessly transfer funds through the SWIFT system.\n\nNobel laureate in economics Ronald Coase's \"Theory of the Firm\" perfectly explains this evolution: when transaction costs are sufficiently low, market mechanisms are more efficient than centralized management. Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem perfectly embodies this principle—by reducing cross-layer transaction costs, it achieves scalability while maintaining the advantages of decentralization.\n\n**Third, why do most people misunderstand this change?**\n\nMisunderstandings about Ethereum's ecosystem transformation in 2025 primarily stem from three cognitive biases: the simplistic thinking trap, the fear of centralization, and an underestimation of systemic risk.\n\nThe first is the simplistic thinking trap. Many people still understand Ethereum through the lens of a \"single blockchain,\" believing that Layer 2 compromises the \"purity of decentralization.\" This is like using horse-drawn logic to criticize modern logistics systems—\"Why so many transfer stations? Wouldn't it be simpler to ship directly from the source to the consumer?\" They fail to realize that complexity is often the price of efficiency, and managing complexity is the core challenge of modern system design.\n\nThe second misconception is an excessive fear of centralization. When people see that the Eigen Layer allows for double staking and that most Layer 2 systems still use centralized sorters, they intuitively perceive this as a betrayal of the principles of decentralization. But this concern overlooks a key fact: these seemingly centralized components are constrained by the economic security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nTake EigenLayer as an example. Many worry that its double-staking mechanism creates systemic risk—if a large \"active validation service\" (AVS) fails, it could lead to a large amount of ETH being slashed simultaneously, compromising the security of the Ethereum mainnet. This concern is not unfounded, as Vitalik Buterin has warned against \"overloading Ethereum consensus.\" However, this risk can be managed through technical and economic mechanisms, not avoided entirely.\n\nTake a home mortgage as an example: you use the same house as collateral for both a mortgage and a home equity loan (HELOC). On the surface, this increases risk—if house prices plummet, you could default on both loans simultaneously. But in reality, as long as you manage your funds appropriately, this \"double-collateralization\" can significantly improve capital efficiency. EigenLayer's double-collateralization follows essentially the same logic.\n\nThe most profound misunderstanding stems from underestimating the risk of Layer 2 fragmentation. Many people only see Layer 2 as reducing transaction costs, but fail to realize that this sharded architecture undermines Ethereum's inherent \"atomic composability.\" On the Ethereum mainnet, you can simultaneously perform flash loans, decentralized trading, and liquidity mining in a single transaction. This seamless combination has created an explosion of innovation in DeFi. However, in a multi-layered Layer 2 environment, this combination becomes complex and expensive.\n\nBehavioral economist Amos Tversky's \"representational heuristic\" explains this cognitive bias: people tend to interpret new phenomena through familiar models. When presented with concepts like Layer 2, double staking, and centralized sequencers, many automatically apply traditional finance risk models, ignoring the unique characteristics of blockchain economics: transparency, verifiability, and the automated execution of economic incentives.\n\nMore importantly, most critics overlook a crucial point: the problem of centralized sorters is temporary. Almost all major Layer 2 platforms (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) currently have clear roadmaps for decentralized sorters. This is like criticizing the early internet for its over-reliance on telephone lines—technological evolution is a process, not a state.\n\n**Philosophical Reflection: When Engineers Become Ecosystem Gardeners**\n\nFrench thinker Michel Serres once said, \"Every technological advancement is a new form of parasitism—it solves old problems while creating new dependencies.\" Ethereum's evolution in 2025 perfectly illustrates this perspective.\n\nTechnically, Ethereum has already solved the scalability trilemma. The Dencun upgrade reduced Layer 2 transaction costs by 100x, and the Pectra upgrade increased verification efficiency and lowered staking thresholds. However, these technological triumphs created new challenges: How to coordinate dozens of Layer 2 networks? How to manage systemic risk across hundreds of AVSs in the Ethereum ecosystem? How to prevent catastrophic failures while maintaining innovation?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's changing role best embodies this paradigm shift. It has evolved from a \"protocol engineer\" to an \"ecosystem gardener\"—no longer directly building infrastructure, but instead funding research, standardizing tool development, and fostering community through the EcoDev program. This shift reflects a profound understanding: in complex systems, direct control is often less effective than indirect guidance.\n\nThis reminds me of the \"knowledge problem\" theory of the Austrian school of economics. Friedrich Hayek argued that in a complex economic system, no central planner possesses sufficient information to make optimal decisions. The best strategy is to establish a sound institutional framework that allows decentralized individuals to make decisions based on local information. Ethereum's modular architecture is the technical implementation of this idea.\n\nHowever, this evolution also presents a philosophical challenge: when we expand \"decentralization\" from a technical concept to an ecosystem design principle, we must accept greater complexity and uncertainty. Just as with the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, there may be chaos and inefficiency in the short term, but in the long term, this decentralized innovation mechanism can foster greater adaptability and resilience. Perhaps the real question isn't \"Is Ethereum's technical complexity in 2025 a good thing or a bad thing?\" but \"Are we ready to coexist with this new form of complexity?\" After all, the strongest ecosystems are often also the most complex. In this era of evolving from monolithic blockchains to modular protocol stacks, what we need to learn isn't how to simplify systems, but how to find beauty and order in complexity. The burden of success may be the price of evolution.",
