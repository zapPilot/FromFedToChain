  "title": "New rules of the game for crypto startups: Why traditional startup advice fails in Web3",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why those tried-and-true methods in traditional tech startups often fail when applied to cryptocurrency projects? From user acquisition costs to product-market fit, from team building to financing strategies, crypto startups seem to require a completely different set of rules. Today, we will deeply analyze this \"protocol economics\" framework and how it completely reshapes the underlying logic of entrepreneurship.  The Nature of the Problem: From \"Customer Acquisition\" to \"Stakeholder Construction\"  The core of traditional entrepreneurship is to build a centralized product or service and then achieve profitability by optimizing user acquisition costs (CAC) and user lifetime value (LTV). But crypto startups face a fundamentally different challenge: you need to build a \"decentralized network\" in which every participant is a partial owner, not just a customer. This difference brings a completely new conceptual framework. Traditional startups pursue \"product-market fit\", while crypto projects need to achieve \"protocol-market fit\". This means that you must not only verify the usability of the product, but also verify four key dimensions at the same time: technical security and scalability, sustainability of the token economy, effectiveness of community governance, and regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Imagine if each of your users is also a shareholder, board member, and regulator of your company, how would you design your business model? This is the complex reality facing crypto entrepreneurs.  Core Framework 1: Redefining Success Metrics  In traditional startups, we focus on daily active users (DAU), monthly recurring revenue (MRR), and customer churn. But in the crypto economy, these metrics often mislead your decisions. Take DAU as an example. A DeFi protocol may only have a few thousand DAUs, but if these users lock up billions of dollars in assets (TVL) and continue to make meaningful transactions, then the protocol is healthier than a project with millions of \"zombie users\". The key is \"protocol sustainability\" rather than pure user growth. More important is the concept of \"token velocity\". In traditional business, the faster money flows, the better. However, in the token economy, if tokens are only used as speculative tools rather than practical functions, high speed indicates a lack of real demand. Successful projects will design \"token sinking mechanisms\" - staking, governance voting, fee burning and other functions, so that tokens can play a real role in the protocol.  Core Framework 2: Tokenization Strategy to Solve the \"Cold Start Problem\"  Traditional platforms face the egg-and-egg problem of a two-sided market: there are no sellers without buyers, and there are no buyers without sellers. Crypto protocols face a more complex \"multi-party network effect\" problem: decentralized exchanges require liquidity providers, traders, and price oracles; blockchains require validators, developers, and users to participate simultaneously. The key to solving this problem is the \"utility first, speculation second\" token design. Take Compound as an example. It first built a well-functioning lending protocol, proved technical feasibility and market demand, and then launched the COMP governance token. The value of the token is directly tied to the actual usage and governance needs of the protocol, rather than pure price speculation. In contrast, many failed projects adopted a \"speculation first\" strategy, attracting users through high token rewards, but without establishing real use cases. Once the rewards are reduced, users will leave, leading to a \"death spiral\".  Core Framework Three: Balancing the Triple Constraint  Crypto entrepreneurship faces a unique \"triple constraint\": technological innovation, economic sustainability, and community governance. Traditional entrepreneurship focuses mainly on products and markets, but crypto projects must optimize these three competing dimensions at the same time. Technological innovation requires rapid iteration and security, but decentralized governance is often slower. Economic sustainability requires long-term value accumulation, but the community may be more concerned with short-term token prices. Democratization of governance is an ideal goal, but professional decision-making requires technical expertise. Successful projects adopt a \"phased decentralization\" strategy. MakerDAO is a typical example: in the early stage, the core team led the technical development and key decisions to establish a safe and stable foundation; in the mid-term, the MKR governance token was introduced to allow the community to participate in important decisions; in the later stage, a complete DAO governance structure was established to balance efficiency and democracy through professional \"core units\".  Core Framework 4: Competitive Advantage of Regulatory Uncertainty  Many entrepreneurs regard regulatory uncertainty as a threat, but for projects that adopt a \"compliance first\" strategy, this is actually a huge competitive advantage. Take Circle's USDC as an example. By establishing a complete compliance framework, regular audits, and transparent proof of reserves, USDC not only did not suffer when the regulatory environment tightened, but also gained a lot of adoption from institutional investors, becoming one of the most trusted stablecoins in the DeFi ecosystem. When other stablecoins faced regulatory questions, USDC's market share grew significantly. The key is to understand: compliance is not a cost, but a ticket to \"institutionalized capital.\" Institutions such as pension funds, insurance companies, and university endowment funds that manage trillions of dollars can only cooperate with projects that meet regulatory requirements. Projects that establish a compliance framework in advance will gain a huge first-mover advantage when regulation is clarified.  Practical wisdom: Avoid crypto-specific failure modes  Crypto startups have several fatal failure modes that are not covered by traditional startup advice. Smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to irreversible financial losses; unsustainable token economics can cause a \"death spiral\"; governance attacks can allow malicious actors to control the entire protocol; \"protocol market matching\" failures can cause network effects to fail to start. Successful entrepreneurs will build these risks into product design: multiple audits and bug bounties to ensure technical security; deep economic modeling and stress testing to verify token economics; multiple signatures and time locks to protect governance security; strategic incentive plans to solve the cold start problem.  Conclusion: Master the New Entrepreneurship Paradigm  Crypto entrepreneurship is not an extension of traditional entrepreneurship, but a completely new business paradigm. It requires entrepreneurs to have the thinking of technical product managers, economists, community builders, and compliance experts at the same time. Most importantly, understand that you are not building a company, but designing an economic system - a decentralized protocol that can sustain, govern, and evolve itself. Master this new set of rules of the game, and you can build a truly sustainable value creation engine in this new field full of opportunities but also full of traps.",
