      "title": "Korean Young People Don't Trust Retirement Funds, Turn to Cryptocurrency for Self-Rescue: A Retirement Warning for Taiwanese People",
      "content": "Have you ever thought about what you would do if you discovered one day that national retirement funds couldn't be relied upon?\n\nThe latest data shows that 75% of young people in Korea (aged 20-39) no longer believe that government-issued retirement funds can secure their future. Even more striking is that 27% of Korean adults aged 20 to 50 now own cryptocurrency, and many consider it an important tool for retirement planning.\n\nThis isn't speculative trading—this is a quiet retirement revolution.\n\nWhy are Koreans doing this?\n\nImagine paying into your retirement fund every month, but knowing deep down that when you retire at 65, this money probably won't be enough to cover your basic living expenses. This is the reality Korean young people are facing.\n\nKorea's economic growth is no longer as robust as before, housing prices have skyrocketed, job opportunities are limited, and traditional savings interest rates are pitifully low. Under these circumstances, young people have started looking for other ways out.\n\nThe data tells us that Koreans treat cryptocurrency investment as 14% of their financial portfolio. This isn't small change—this is strategic allocation after careful consideration. 78% say they use cryptocurrency to accumulate funds, and 53% explicitly state they're preparing for retirement through cryptocurrency.\n\nMost interestingly, the highest participation rate isn't among people in their 20s, but among those in their 40s, reaching 31%. What does this tell us? It shows this isn't a momentary impulse by young people, but a rational choice made by middle-aged people who are about to face retirement pressure.\n\nWhat should Taiwanese people learn from this?\n\nFirst, we need to face a reality: retirement fund systems worldwide are facing challenges. Population aging, slowing economic growth, government fiscal pressure—these problems aren't unique to Korea; Taiwan will face them too.\n\nSecond, the Korean approach is worth our consideration, but this doesn't mean we should blindly copy it. Cryptocurrency does provide a new asset class, but its risks are also real. Bitcoin can rise or fall by more than 10% in a single day, and this volatility poses enormous challenges for retirement funds.\n\nSo what should we do?\n\nFirst, re-examine your retirement planning. Don't rely entirely on labor insurance, labor pension, or civil servant retirement funds. While these systems are important, they may not be sufficient to maintain the quality of retirement life you expect.\n\nSecond, consider diversifying your asset allocation. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to buy Bitcoin, but you need to think about what options beyond time deposits, stocks, and mutual funds can help you fight inflation and achieve long-term wealth growth.\n\nThird, if you really consider cryptocurrency, please treat it as a high-risk, high-volatility asset. While Koreans allocate 14% of their investment portfolio to cryptocurrency, they also bear corresponding risks.\n\nFourth, continue learning and following trends. Fintech, digital assets, and new investment tools are constantly emerging. Maintaining an open mindset and learning habits is essential for making wise decisions in a changing world.\n\nDeeper reflection\n\nThe choices of Korean young people reflect a deeper problem: the traditional social contract is changing. The old agreement was that if you worked hard, paid taxes on time, and followed the rules, the state and society would guarantee your retirement life. But now this agreement has become less reliable.\n\nUnder these circumstances, individuals need to take on more responsibility and make more choices. This is both a challenge and an opportunity.\n\nKoreans have chosen cryptocurrency as one of their self-rescue solutions. What will Taiwanese people choose?\n\nPerhaps the answer lies not in choosing any specific investment tool, but in cultivating a new way of thinking: no longer passively relying on systems, but actively taking responsibility for your own future.\n\nNo matter what you ultimately choose to invest in, the important thing is to start taking action. Because time won't wait for anyone, and the day of retirement will always come."
