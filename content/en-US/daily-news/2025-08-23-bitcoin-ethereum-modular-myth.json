  "title": "Do Bitcoin and Ethereum really complement each other? Debunking the myth of modular blockchains",
  "content": "In the blockchain world, there's a seemingly plausible narrative: Bitcoin is the conservative \"settlement layer,\" while Ethereum is the innovative \"application layer.\" The two aren't competitors, but rather complementary partners. This narrative is so elegant that many accept it without question. However, a closer, more critical examination reveals that this \"division of labor\" story may be more complex than we imagined.\n\nImagine this scenario: Your friend tells you, \"Apple and Microsoft aren't competitors. Apple specializes in hardware, Microsoft specializes in software; they complement each other.\" You might laugh and say, \"Come on, they're directly competing in many areas, aren't they?\" But in the blockchain space, similar logic is widely accepted.\n\nThis topic may seem far-fetched, but it actually concerns our fundamental understanding of the future of financial infrastructure‚Äîon the surface, it's a matter of choosing a technological path, but the real issue is how we understand the nature of innovation and competition.\n\nThe core concept we'll discuss today is \"competitiveness in modular blockchains\"‚Äîthe concept that, in the process of technological evolution, seemingly complementary systems are often actually competing for the same ecological niche.\n\n## First, how is modular blockchain typically understood?\n\nThe current mainstream narrative is this: Traditional monolithic blockchains (like early Ethereum) centralize all functions‚Äîconsensus, execution, data availability, and settlement‚Äîon a single chain, which is inefficient. Modular blockchains, on the other hand, divide these functions into layers, allowing each layer to be optimized independently.\n\nWithin this framework, Bitcoin is positioned as the \"ultimate settlement layer\"‚Äîit boasts the strongest security, with zero major security incidents in 16 years, making it suitable to serve as the final arbiter for other layers. Ethereum, on the other hand, is positioned as an \"innovation experimentation platform\"‚Äîit boldly experiments with new technologies, tests risks first, and paves the way for the entire ecosystem.\n\nSupporters of this view might say, \"Look, Bitcoin focuses on security and stability, while Ethereum focuses on programmability and innovation. Isn't that a perfect division of labor?\"\n\nThe logic sounds beautiful, like the \"theory of comparative advantage\" in economics textbooks‚Äîeach country specializes in its strongest industry, then trades with each other, and everyone benefits.\n\nBut in reality, technological evolution often resembles biological evolution‚Äînot a planned division of labor, but a fierce struggle for survival.\n\n## Second, what kind of analysis is more objective?\n\nA more objective analysis requires looking at the actual trajectory of technological development and market behavior, not at rosy theoretical visions.\n\nFirst, let's examine the actual evidence of \"technology transfer.\" If Ethereum were truly Bitcoin's \"test chain,\" we should see a significant flow of technology from Ethereum to Bitcoin. But what is the reality? Bitcoin's main chain has adopted almost no significant Ethereum technology over the past decade. Smart contracts, account models, proof of stake, sharding‚Äînone of these core Ethereum innovations have been adopted by Bitcoin.\n\nInstead, we're seeing \"competitive modularization\"‚Äîeach major ecosystem is building its own complete modular stack. Ethereum isn't just the execution layer; it's also the settlement, consensus, and data availability layers of its own Layer 2 ecosystem. Layer 2 platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync all choose Ethereum for settlement, not Bitcoin.\n\nFrom a security perspective, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) represent two different security philosophies, not a superior-or-inferior relationship. PoW secures the network with external resources (electricity), while PoS secures the network with internal capital (staked ETH). PoS also has a feature that PoW lacks: the attacker's capital can be \"slashed\" and permanently destroyed, presenting a more direct economic threat.\n\nThe smartest approach is to recognize that this isn't a division of labor, but rather parallel evolution. The Bitcoin ecosystem is attempting to build its own application layer (through the Lightning Network, Ordinals, sidechains, etc.), while the Ethereum ecosystem is strengthening its narrative as a \"store of value\" (with the \"ultrasonic currency\" concept).\n\n## Third, why do most people accept the \"complementary\" narrative?\n\nCognitive science tells us that the human brain prefers simple, coherent explanations. The \"complementarity theory\" satisfies our desire for order‚Äîeverything has its place, there's no waste, no conflict, how perfect!\n\nThis mindset, common in business analysis and known as the \"blue ocean fallacy,\" assumes that the market can be neatly divided, allowing different companies to peacefully coexist within their respective niches. In reality, however, the most successful companies are often those that continually expand their boundaries and encroach on competitors' territory.\n\nIn the blockchain space, this fallacy is particularly alluring, as the concept of \"decentralization\" implies collaboration rather than competition. But technological reality is harsh: network effects, developer resources, and user attention are all scarce resources, and different blockchain ecosystems will inevitably compete for them.\n\nAnother cognitive trap is the \"status quo bias\"‚Äîwe tend to believe that the current technological landscape is stable. Bitcoin is currently \"just\" digital gold, and Ethereum is currently \"just\" a smart contract platform, so they will never invade each other's territory. But technological boundaries are fluid. Ethereum's \"ultrasonic currency\" mechanism (destroying ETH through EIP-1559) directly challenges Bitcoin's scarcity narrative. The debate within the Bitcoin community over Ordinals also reveals its potential and resistance to expansion at the application layer.\n\nThe most dangerous is the \"authority bias\"‚Äîwhen a narrative is repeated by enough authoritative figures, it acquires undeserved credibility. The \"modular complementarity theory\" is frequently mentioned in the crypto media, but its technical and economic assumptions are rarely examined in depth.\n\n## Philosophical Reflection: The Dialectical Relationship between Competition and Innovation\n\nPerhaps we need to rethink the role of competition in technological innovation. Darwin's theory of evolution teaches us that competition is the engine of innovation, not something to be avoided. The greatest biodiversity in the biological world often occurs at the intersection of ecological niches where competition is most intense.\n\nThe \"competitive coexistence\" of Bitcoin and Ethereum may be more valuable than \"harmonious division of labor.\" It was Ethereum's success that forced the Bitcoin community to consider how to increase functionality while preserving its core principles. It was the strength of Bitcoin's \"digital gold\" narrative that led Ethereum to develop its own theory of money properties.\n\nThis competition has spurred innovation: Layer 2 technology, cross-chain bridges, wrapped assets (such as WBTC), and experiments with new consensus mechanisms. If the two truly followed the preconceived \"division of labor and cooperation,\" we might actually lose the impetus for these innovations.\n\nReturning to the original question: Do Bitcoin and Ethereum truly complement each other? The answer may be: they both compete and coexist, both in opposition and in unity. This complex relationship reflects the true nature of technological evolution more closely than any simple \"division of labor\" theory.\n\nIn a rapidly changing technological world, it's more important to maintain critical thinking than to embrace comfortable narratives. The next time someone tells you that two technologies \"complement each other perfectly,\" ask, \"Really? Where's the evidence?\"",
