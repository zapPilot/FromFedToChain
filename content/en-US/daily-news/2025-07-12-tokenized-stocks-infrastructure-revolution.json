  "title": "The Tokenized Stock Revolution: When Financial Infrastructure Begins to Fit You, Rather Than You Fit It",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why it is so troublesome for you living in Taiwan to buy a US stock? Account opening, remittance, time difference, fees, tax declaration... a series of obstacles have deterred many people. But if I tell you that there is a new way that is quietly changing all this, making investing in the global stock market as easy as buying a cup of coffee on your mobile phone, would you believe it?   The \"Copernican Revolution\" of Financial Infrastructure In the past few months, a concept called \"tokenized stocks\" has begun to attract attention in the financial circle. Simply put, it is to use blockchain technology to \"package\" traditional stocks into digital tokens, so that you can use a cryptocurrency wallet to buy and sell Tesla, Apple, and Pfizer stocks. It sounds cool, but what is the deeper meaning? This represents a fundamental shift in the thinking of financial services: from \"requiring users to adapt to the financial system\" to \"making the financial system adapt to user needs.\" Imagine that in the past, to invest in U.S. stocks, you needed to: find a supporting brokerage, prepare a bunch of English documents, wait for account opening review, wire U.S. dollars, bear exchange rate losses, endure time zone restrictions... The whole process may take several weeks. Now, the tokenized stock platform allows you to use stable currencies to buy U.S. stocks at any time through a mobile app in a few minutes. No traditional brokerage account is required, no complicated international remittances are required, and even fractional shares can be purchased - for example, 0.1 shares of Berkshire stock can be purchased with $50.   This is not the first time that an innovation has been \"ridiculed\" If you think this sounds \"too radical\" or \"unreliable\", I completely understand. Because every innovation that has truly changed the financial industry in history has been ridiculed by mainstream institutions at the beginning. In the 1990s, when ETFs (index stock funds) first appeared, traditional fund managers on Wall Street thought it was a \"strange experiment\". They said, \"Who would want a strange thing that is neither a stock nor a fund?\", \"This will make the market chaotic!\" What is the result? Today, ETFs manage more than $10 trillion in assets and have become one of the most important investment tools in the world. It has turned diversified investments that were originally only available to the rich into financial services that ordinary people can afford. Tokenized stocks are following the same path. The core problem it solves is that of the $255 trillion in tradable securities in the world, only $28.6 trillion is actively circulating. Most assets are trapped in various geographical, regulatory, and technological barriers.   The real game changer: fractional ownership The most revolutionary thing about tokenized stocks is not the technology itself, but that it redefines the concept of \"ownership.\" Traditional stock investment has an invisible threshold: buying a whole share. Want to invest in Eastman Kodak? One share costs $150. Want to invest in Berkshire Hathaway? One share costs $500,000. For most people, this is an astronomical figure. But tokenization technology can cut a stock into tens of millions of \"molecules.\" You can buy a small portion of Berkshire with $10 and a small portion of Tesla with $20. This is not just about lowering the threshold, but fundamentally changing who can participate in the global capital market. Imagine an Uber driver in the Philippines who saves $100 a month. In the past, he could only buy local bank deposits or government bonds. Now, he can use stable currencies to invest in US technology stocks, German industrial stocks, and Japanese consumer stocks to build a truly global investment portfolio.   Regulatory \"debt instrument\" ingenuity You may ask: This sounds great, will regulators allow it? This is the smartest part of tokenized stocks. Platforms like Backed Finance do not directly issue \"stock tokens\", but \"debt instrument tokens\". Specifically, what you buy is not Tesla stock itself, but a \"debt certificate\", the value of which tracks Tesla's stock price 1:1. The platform actually holds the corresponding Tesla stock in a Swiss-regulated bank, and your token is the legal debt claim on these stocks. This structure is very clever: it circumvents complex cross-border securities laws while ensuring the equivalence of economic value. You can still enjoy the benefits of Tesla's rising stock price, but in the legal framework, this is classified as a \"debt instrument\" rather than a \"security\". This is like a \"Trojan horse\" for financial innovation - using a form that is acceptable to the existing regulatory framework to achieve functions that were originally not allowed.   Opportunities for emerging markets to turn around For investors in developed countries, tokenized stocks may just be a \"more convenient way to invest.\" But for billions of people in emerging markets, this may be an opportunity to change their destiny. Take Turkey as an example. In the past few years, the lira has depreciated sharply, and local investors are in urgent need of US dollar assets to preserve value. But the Turkish government restricts foreign exchange purchases, and traditional channels for buying US stocks are difficult. Tokenized stocks provide them with a \"digital silk road\": through stablecoins and blockchains, bypassing the limitations of the traditional financial system. McKinsey predicts that the size of the tokenized market may reach 2 trillion US dollars by 2030. But the more important number is: 1.7 billion people in the world do not have bank accounts, but have mobile phones. Tokenization technology may open the door to the global investment market for these people for the first time.   Risks and Challenges: There is no free lunch Of course, no financial innovation is perfect. Tokenized stocks face several key challenges:  Liquidity dispersion problem : Currently, most tokenized stocks have small trading volumes and large spreads. This is like breaking up the large pond originally concentrated in the New York Stock Exchange into countless small puddles.  Technical risks : Smart contracts may have bugs, blockchains may be hacked, and private keys may be lost. These risks do not exist in traditional stock investments.  Regulatory uncertainty : Although the current \"debt instrument\" structure is legal, regulations may change at any time. A policy turn may bring the entire market to a standstill.  Education threshold : It is not easy for ordinary investors to understand concepts such as tokens, wallets, private keys, and DeFi. Technical thresholds may limit the speed of popularization.   Financial map of the next decade Despite these challenges, the trend represented by tokenized stocks is irreversible. Traditional financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have begun to launch tokenized fund products. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have set up regulatory sandboxes to support related innovations. More importantly, the beneficiaries of this change are not just investors, but also include:  Enterprises : Excellent companies in emerging markets can more easily reach global investors and reduce financing costs.  Financial institutions : Traditional banks and securities firms can expand into new markets and improve efficiency through tokenized services.  Government : The improvement of financial inclusion is conducive to economic development and social stability.   Action Guide for Individual Investors So, as an individual investor, how should you deal with this trend?  Short-term : Keep observing and test the waters with a small amount. You can try to invest a small amount in tokenized stocks to experience new investment methods, but don't invest a large amount of money.  Medium-term : Learn relevant knowledge. Understand basic concepts such as blockchain, DeFi, and digital wallets. These skills will become increasingly important in the future.  Long-term : Rethink your portfolio. As tokenization matures, your investment options will increase dramatically. Plan ahead to optimize your asset allocation using these new tools. Most importantly, understand the nature of this change: we are witnessing a historic shift in financial services from \"institution-centered\" to \"user-centered\". Just as the Internet democratized information, tokenization is democratizing investing. This is not just a technological innovation, but a leap forward in financial inclusion. The next time you see the term \"tokenized stocks\", remember: this is not just another cryptocurrency gimmick, but a fundamental reconfiguration of financial infrastructure. A new world where financial services truly serve everyone is unfolding before our eyes.",
