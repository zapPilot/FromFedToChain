# Publish Date Fix Implementation

## Problem

Episodes on the HomeScreen were always showing "today" as the publish time instead of the correct date parsed from the episode ID.

## Solution

Added a new `publishDate` getter to the `AudioFile` model that:

1. Parses the date from the `id` field (format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title`)
2. Falls back to `lastModified` if parsing fails
3. Uses regex validation to ensure proper date format

## Changes Made

### 1. AudioFile Model (`app/lib/models/audio_file.dart`)

- Added `publishDate` getter that extracts date from ID
- Uses regex pattern `r'^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$'` to validate date format
- Parses first 10 characters of ID as date (e.g., "2025-07-05" from "2025-07-05-blockchain-private-equity-tokenization")
- Falls back to `lastModified` if parsing fails

### 2. Audio Item Card (`app/lib/widgets/audio_item_card.dart`)

- Changed `_formatDate(audioFile.lastModified)` to `_formatDate(audioFile.publishDate)`
- Now displays correct publish date instead of "today"

### 3. Content Service (`app/lib/services/content_service.dart`)

- Updated all sorting logic to use `publishDate` instead of `lastModified`
- Affects both `_applySorting()` method and main episodes loading
- Ensures episodes are sorted by actual publish date

## Testing

- Flutter analyze shows no critical errors (only deprecation warnings)
- All tests pass successfully
- Implementation handles edge cases with proper fallback to `lastModified`

## Impact

- Episodes now show correct publish dates (e.g., "3 days ago", "Jul 5, 2025")
- Sorting by date now uses actual publish dates for better chronological ordering
- Improved user experience with accurate temporal information
