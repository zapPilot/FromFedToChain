# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.
#
# CONFIGURATION RATIONALE:
# - Cosmetic deprecation warnings (withOpacity, surfaceVariant) are suppressed
#   as they don't affect audio streaming functionality and would require
#   extensive refactoring for minimal benefit
# - BuildContext async warnings suppressed for demo files only
# - Focus on legitimate code quality issues (unused imports, unused elements)

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
