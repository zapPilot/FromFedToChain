- **URL validation** and exception handling
- **Edge cases** and performance optimization

### 4. Integration Tests (`test/integration/`)

#### User Flows Integration Tests (`user_flows_integration_test.dart`)

- **Episode Discovery Flow**: Browse → Filter → Search → Select
- **Audio Playback Flow**: Play → Control → Navigate Episodes
- **Filter and Search Flow**: Language/Category → Search → Results
- **Player Screen Flow**: Mini Player → Full Player → Controls
- **Error Handling**: Loading states, error states, rapid interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Large lists, rapid filter changes, memory usage
