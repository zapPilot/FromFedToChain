## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing daily-news content, verify:

- [ ] **Daily Relevance**: Does this affect people's financial decisions today?
- [ ] **Clear Impact**: Can you explain "so what?" in simple terms?
- [ ] **Actionable**: Does audience know what to do with this information?
- [ ] **Timely**: Is this current and relevant news (not weeks old)?
- [ ] **Balanced**: Presents both benefits and risks fairly?
- [ ] **Accessible**: Would someone unfamiliar with crypto understand this?

## Example Topics That Work Well

### **Great Examples:**

- "美國通膨數據出爐，比特幣為什麼成為避險選擇？"
- "聯準會升息對你的投資組合意味著什麼？"
- "用比特幣買房成為可能：新金融工具的機會與風險"
- "美元走弱，為什麼加密貨幣開始受到關注？"

### **Avoid These:**

- "以太坊2.0技術升級詳解"
- "某小幣種暴漲1000%分析"
- "NFT藝術品市場趨勢"
- "DeFi協議代碼審計結果"
- 不要介紹股價、幣價的變化，我們無法預測用戶也學不到什麼："聯準會降息了，你的加密貨幣投資為什麼反而下跌？12月18日，美國聯邦儲備理事會宣布降息25個基點，將基準利率調降至4.25%到4.5%之間。這是今年第三次連續降息，也是自2022年12月以來的最低水準。按理說，降息應該讓錢變得更便宜，投資人更願意把錢投入風險較高的資產，比如加密貨幣。但現實卻給了我們一個耳光。比特幣在聯準會宣布後下跌了4%，以太坊和Solana的跌幅更大，分別下跌5%和6%"
